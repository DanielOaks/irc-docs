<h1>Protocol changes for +TSora</h1>
<hr>
<p>
Note: <br>
The protocols described here implement TimeStamps on IRC channels and
nicks. The idea of IRC TimeStamps was started on Undernet, and first
implemented by Run &lt;carlo@runaway.xs4all.nl&gt;. The protocols used here
are not exactly the same as the ones used on Undernet; the nick-kill
handling is very similar and must be credited to Run, while the
&quot;TimeStamped channel description&quot; protocol is quite different.

<p>
Note: <br>
This document has been adapted to TS3.

<p><p>
TSora servers keep track of which version of the TS protocol (if any)
their neighboring servers are using, and take it into account when
sending messages to them. This allows for seamless integration of
TS servers into a non-TS net, and for upgrades of the protocol.
<p>
Each server knows which is the lowest and the highest version of the
TS protocol it can interact with; currently both of these are set to 3:
<p>
<pre>
#define TS_CURRENT 3		/* the highest TS ver we can do */
#define TS_MIN 3		/* the lowest TS ver we can do  */
</pre>
<p><hr><p>

<h2>Timings and TS versions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keep a &quot;delta&quot; value to be added to the result of all calls to <code>time()</code>,
initially 0.<p>
<li>Send a second argument to the <code>PASS</code> command, ending in the 'TS' string.<p>
<li>Send a
  <pre>
        SVINFO &lt;<var>TS_CURRENT</var>&gt; &lt;<var>TS_MIN</var>&gt; &lt;<var>STANDALONE</var>&gt; :&lt;<var>UTC-TIME</var>&gt; </pre><br>
  just after <code>SERVER</code>, where 
  &lt;<var>STANDALONE</var>&gt; is 1 if we're connected to more TSora servers, and 0 if 
  not, and &lt;<var>UTC-TIME</var>&gt; is our idea of the current UTC time, fixed with 
  the delta.<p>
<li> When we receive a &quot;<code>SVINFO &lt;<var>x</var>&gt; &lt;<var>y</var>&gt; &lt;<var>z</var>&gt; :&lt;<var>t</var>&gt;</code>&quot; line from a connecting 
  server, we ignore it if <var>TS_CURRENT&lt;y</var> or <var>x&lt;TS_MIN</var>, otherwise we
  set a flag remembering that that server is TS-aware, remember the TS 
  version to use with it (<code>min(<var>TS_CURRENT</var>, <var>x</var>)</code>). Additionally, if this is 
  our first connected TS server, we set our delta to <code>t-&lt;OUR_UTC&gt;</code> if
  <code><var>z</var>==0</code>, and to <code>(<var>t</var>-&lt;<var>OUR_UTC</var>&gt;)/2</code> if <code><var>z</var>!=0</code>. The <code>SVINFO</code> data is kept around
  until the server has effectively registered with <code>SERVER</code>, and used
  <em>after</em> sending our own <code>SVINFO</code> to that server. <p>
</ul>

Explanations:
<p>
<blockquote>
  Servers will always know which of their directly-linked servers
  can do TS, and will use the TS protocol only with servers that
  do understand it. This makes it possible to switch to full TS
  in just one code-replacement step, without incompatibilities.
<p>
  As long as not all servers are TS-aware, the net will be divided
  into &quot;zones&quot; of linked TS-aware servers. Channel modes will be
  kept synchronized at least within the zone in which the channel
  was created, and nick collisions between servers in the same
  zone will result in only one client being killed.
<p>
  Time synchronization ensures that servers have the same idea of the 
  current time, and achieves this purpose as long as TS servers are 
  introduced one by one within the same 'zone'. The merging of two zones 
  cannot synchronize them completely, but it is to be expected that 
  within each zone the effective time will be very close to the real 
  time. 
<p>
  By sending TSINFO after SERVER rather than before, we avoid the extra
  lag created by the identd check on the server. To be able to send
  immediately a connect burst of either type (TS or not), we need to
  know before that if the server does TS or not, so we send that
  information with PASS as an extra argument. And to avoid being
  incompatible with 2.9 servers, which check that this second argument
  begins with "2.9", we check that it *ends* with "TS".
<p>
  The current time is only used when setting a TS on a new channel or 
  nick, and once such a TS is set, it is never modified because of 
  synchronization, as it is much more important that the TS for a 
  channel or nick stays the same across all servers than that it is 
  accurate to the second.
<p>
  Note that Undernet's 2.8.x servers have no time synchronization at all, and have had no
  problems because of it - all of this is more to catch the occasional
  server with a way-off clock than anything.

<h2>NICK handling patches (anti nick-collide + shorter connect burst):</h2>
<ul> 
<li>For each nick, store a TS value = the TS value received if any, or our 
  <code>UTC+delta</code> at the time we first heard of the nick. TS's are propagated 
  to TS-aware servers whenever sending a <code>NICK</code> command.<p>

<li>Nick changes reset the TS to the current time.<p>

<li> When sending a connect burst to another TS server, replace the 
  <code>NICK/USER</code> pair with only one <code>NICK</code> command containing the nick, the 
  hopcount, the TS, the umode, and all the <code>USER</code> information.<p>

  The format for a full NICK line is:
<pre>
       NICK &lt;<var>nick</var>&gt; &lt;<var>hops</var>&gt; &lt;<var>TS</var>&gt; &lt;<var>umode</var>&gt; &lt;<var>user</var>&gt; &lt;<var>host</var>&gt; &lt;<var>server</var>&gt; :&lt;<var>ircname</var>&gt;</pre><br>

  The umode is a <code>+</code> followed by any applying usermodes.<p>

  The format for a nick-change NICK line is:
<pre>
       :&lt;<var>oldnick</var>&gt; NICK &lt;<var>newnick</var>&gt; :&lt;<var>TS</var>&gt;</pre><p>

<li> When a <code>NICK</code> is received from a TS server, that conflicts with an 
  existing nick:
  <ul>
  <li> if the userhosts differ or one is not known:
    <ul>
    <li> if the timestamps are equal, kill ours and the old one if it
	 was a nick change
    <li> if the incoming timestamp is older than ours, kill ours and 
      propagate the new one
    <li> if the incoming timestamp is younger, ignore the line, but kill
       the old nick if it was a nick change
    </ul>
  <li> if the userhosts are the same:
    <ul>
    <li> if the timestamps are equal, kill ours and the old one if it
      was a nick change
    <li> if the incoming timestamp is younger, kill ours and propagate
      the new one
    <li> if the incoming timestamp is older, ignore the line but kill
      the old nick if it was a nick change
    </ul>
  </ul>
<br>
<li> When a <code>NICK</code> is received from a non-TS server that conflicts with
  an existing nick, kill both.<p>

<li> Do not send &quot;Fake Prefix&quot; kills in response to lines coming from TS 
  servers; the sanitization works anyway, and this allows the &quot;newer
  nick overruled&quot; case to work.<p>
</ul>

Explanations:
<p>
<blockquote>
  The modified nick-introduction syntax allows for a slightly shorter 
  connect-burst, and most importantly lets the server compare 
  user@host's when determining which nick to kill:  if the user@host
  is the same, then the older nick must be killed rather than the
  newer.
<p>
  When talking to a non-TS server, we need to behave exactly like one
  because it expects us to. When talkign to a TS server, we don't kill
  the nicks it's introducing, as we know it'll be smart enough to do it
  itself when seeing our own introduced nick.
<p>
  When we see a nick arriving from a non-TS server, it won't have a TS, 
  but it's safe enough to give it the current time rather than keeping 
  it 0; such TS's won't be the same all across the network (as long as 
  there is more than one TS zone), and when there's a collision, the TS 
  used will be the one in the zone the collision occurs in.
<p>
  Also, it is important to note that by the time a server sees (and 
  chooses to ignore) a nick introduction, the introducing server has 
  also had the time to put umode changes for that nick on its queue, so 
  we must ignore them too... so we need to ignore fake-prefix lines 
  rather than sending kills for them. This is safe enough, as the rest 
  of the protocol ensures that they'll get killed anyway (and the 
  Undernet does it too, so it's been more than enough tested). Just for 
  an extra bit of compatibility, we still kill fake prefixes coming from 
  non-TS servers.
<p>
  This part of the TS protocol is almost exactly the same as the
  Undernet's .anc (anti-nick-collide) patches, except that Undernet
  servers don't add usermodes to the <code>NICK</code> line.

<h2>TimeStamped channel descriptions (avoiding hacked ops and desynchs):</h2>
<ul>
<li> For each channel, keep a timestamp, set to the current time when the
  channel is created by a client on the local server, or to the received
  value if the channel has been propagated from a TS server, or to 0  
  otherwise. This value will have the semantics of "the time of creation
  of the current ops on the channel", and 0 will mean that the channel 
  is in non-TS mode.                                                   
<p>
<li> A new server protocol command is introduced, <code>SJOIN</code>, which introduces
  a full channel description: a timestamp, all the modes (except bans),
  and the list of channel members with their ops and voices.
  This command will be
  used instead of <code>JOIN</code> and of (some) <code>MODE</code>s both in connect bursts and
  when propagating channel creations among TS servers. <code>SJOIN</code> will never
  be accepted from or sent to users.<p>

  The syntax for the command is:
  <pre>
   SJOIN &lt;<var>TS</var>&gt; #&lt;<var>channel</var>&gt; &lt;<var>modes</var>&gt; :[+][@]&lt;<var>nick_1</var>&gt; ...  [+][@]&lt;<var>nick_n</var>&gt;</pre><br>

  The fields have the following meanings:<p>
  <ul>
    <li> &lt;<var>TS</var>&gt; is the timestamp for the channel<p>
    <li> &lt;<var>modes</var>&gt; is the list of global channel modes, starting with a <code>+</code>
    and a letter for each of the active modes (<code>spmntkil</code>), followed
    by an argument for <code>+l</code> if there is a limit, and an argument for
    <code>+k</code> if there's a key (in the same order they were mentioned in
    the string of letters).<p>

    A channel with no modes will have a <code>+</code> in that field.<p>

    A special value of <code>0</code> means that the server does not specify the
    modes, and will be used when more than one <code>SJOIN</code> line is needed
    to completely describe a channel, or when propagating a <code>SJOIN</code>
    the modes of which were rejected. <p>

    <li> Each nick is preceded by a <code>@</code> if the user has ops, and a <code>+</code> if
    the user has a voice. For mode <code>+ov</code>, both flags are used.<p>
  </ul>

       <code>SJOIN</code>s will be propagated (when appropriate) to neighboring TS
  servers, and converted to <code>JOIN</code>s and <code>MODE</code>s for neighboring non-TS
  servers.<p>

  To propagate channels for which not all users fit in one <code>SJOIN</code> line,
  several <code>SJOIN</code>'s will be sent consecutively, only the first
    one including actual information in the &lt;<var>mode</var>&gt; field.<p>

  An extra ad-hoc restriction
  is imposed on <code>SJOIN</code> messages, to simplify processing: if a channel has
  ops, then the first &lt;<var>nick</var>&gt; of the first <code>SJOIN</code> sent to propagate that
  channel must be one of the ops.<p>

  Servers will never attempt to reconstruct a <code>SJOIN</code> from <code>JOIN<code>/</code>MODE</code>
  information being received at the moment from other servers.<p>

<li> For each user on a channel, keep an extra flag (like ops and voice)
  that is set when the user has received channel ops from another 
  server (in a <code>SJOIN</code> channel description), which we rejected (ignored). Mode changes (but NOT kicks) coming 
  from a TS server and from someone with this flag set will ignored.
  The flag will be reset when the user gets ops from another user 
  or server.<p>

<li> On deops done by non-local users,
  coming from TS servers, on channels with a non-zero TS, do not check
  that the user has ops but check that their 'deopped' flag is not set.
  For kicks coming from a TS server, do not check either. This will 
  avoid desynchs, and 'bad' modechanges are avoided anyway. Other mode
  changes will still only be taken into account and 
  propagated when done by users that are seen as having ops.<p>

<li> When a <code>MODE</code> change that ops someone is received from a server for a channel, that
  channel's TS is set to 0, and the mode change is propagated.<p>

<li> When a <code>SJOIN</code> is received for a channel, deal with it in this way:
  <ul>
  <li> received-TS = 0 or own TS = 0: set own TS to 0, propagate a 0.
  <li> received-TS &lt; own-TS:
    <ul>
    <li> if the <code>SJOIN</code> ops someone, remove *all* modes (except bans) from
	the channel and propagate these mode changes to all neighboring non-TS servers, and copy the received TS and propagate the <code>SJOIN</code>.
    <li> if the <code>SJOIN</code> does not op anyone and we have ops, propagate with our own TS.
    <li> otherwise, copy the received TS and propagate the <code>SJOIN</code>.
    </ul>
  <li> received-TS &gt; own-TS: 
    <ul>
    <li> if the <code>SJOIN</code> does not introduce any ops, process and propagate
	with our own TS.
    <li> if we have ops: for each person the mode change would op, set
      the 'deopped' flag; process all JOINs ignoring the '@' and '+' flags;
      propagate without the flags and with our TS.
    <li> if we don't have ops: set our TS to the received one, propagate,
	with the flags
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>
  <li> When a local user joins a channel, whether this channel exists or
    not, an SJOIN must be generated, and not a JOIN, to send to other TS
    servers.
</ul>

Explanations:
<p>
<blockquote>
  This part of the protocol is the one that is most different (and
  incompatible) with the Undernet's: we never timestamp <code>MODE</code> changes,
  but instead we introduce the concept of time-stamped channel
  descriptions. This way each server can determine, based on its state
  and the received description, what the correct modes for a channel
  are, and deop its own users if necessary. With this protocol, there is
  *never* the need to reverse and bounce back a mode change. This is
  both faster and more bandwith-effective.
<p>
  The end goal is to have a protocol will eventually protect channels
  against hacked ops, while minimizing the impact on a mixed-server net.
  In order to do this, whenever there is a conflict between a TS server
  and a non-TS one, the non-TS one's idea of the whole situation
  prevails. This means that channels will only have a TS when they have
  been created on a TS-aware server, and will lose it whenever a server
  op comes from a non-TS server. Also, at most one 'zone' will have a
  TS for any given channel at any given time, ensuring that there won't
  be any deops when zones are merged. However, when TS zones are merged,
  if the side that has a TS also has ops, then the TS is kept across
  the whole new zone.
<p> 
  Effective protection will only be ensured once all servers run TS 
  patches and channels have been re-created, as there is no way servers 
  can assign a TS to a channel they are not creating (like they do with 
  nicks) without having unwanted deops later.
<p>
  The visible effects of this are that when a split rejoins, and one
  side has hacked ops, the other side doesn't see any server mode changes
  (just like with Undernet), but the side that has hacked ops sees:<p>
  <ul>
  <li> first the first server on the other side deopping and devoicing
  everyone, and fixing the <code>+spmntkli</code> modes<p>
  <li> then other users joining, and getting server ops and voices
  </ul>
<p>
  The less obvious part of this protocol is its behavior in the case 
  that the younger side of a rejoin has servers that are lagged with 
  each other. In such a situation, a <code>SJOIN</code> that clears all modes and 
  sets the legitimate ones is being propagated from one server, and 
  lagged illegitimate mode changes and kicks are being propagated in the 
  opposite direction. In this case, a kick done by someone who is being 
  deopped by the <code>SJOIN</code> must be taken into account to keep the name list 
  in sync (and since it can only be kicking someone who also was on the 
  younger side), while a deop does not matter (and will be ignored by
  the first server on the other side), and an opping *needs* to be
  discareded to avoid hacked ops.
<p>
  The main property of timestamped channel descriptions that makes them
  a very stable protocol even with lag and splits, is that they leave a
  server in the same final state, independently of the order in which
  channel descriptions coming from different servers are received. Even
  when <code>SJOIN</code>s and <code>MODE</code>s for the same channel are being propagated in
  different direction because of several splits rejoining, the final
  state will be the same, independently of the exact order in which each
  server received the <code>SJOIN</code>s, and will be the same across all the
  servers in the same zone.
