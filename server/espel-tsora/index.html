<a name="TS4"></a><h2>The TS4 patches</h2>

<p>
&quot;TS4&quot; is a patch-set for EFnet's ircd code, which adds a lot
of more or less related features, such as password-based channel
persistency, two levels of ops, exception lists for bans, server-side
unique session IDs, cookie-based short-term op recovery, nick kill
recovery, server link compression, and a bunch of other things.

<p>
I developped the TS4 code during 1997-1998, as an experimental proposal
for the technical evolution of EFnet.  This lead to a huge controversy,
where the most political parts of TS4 (channel passwords and half-ops)
were voted down.  Since then, many of the other TS4 features have been
slowly integrated into EFnet's mainstream ircds.

<p>
This section documents the original TS4 code, which as far as I know is
not currently in use in any IRC network.

<h3>Documentation</h3>

</ul>

<h3>Testing</h3>
The test servers have been shut down; the beta testing was successful,
and helped uncover a large number of bugs.

<h3>News</h3>
Things that have changed recently:
<ul>
<li>Release 1.0 is out, and all the debugging stuff is gone.  This is
    the TS4 code as was originally intended; maybe some small net will
    want to try what EFnet didn't quite end up liking.
</ul>

<a name="overview"></a><h2>Overview of EFnet's TS protocol</h2>

<p>
Long before TS4, I developped the original TimeStamping patches for
EFnet, which borrowed the main idea from Undernet's TS code, but adapted
to EFnet's servers, and with some differences in the design of the
protocol.

<p>
TimeStamping allows IRC servers to react more intelligently to nickname 
clashes (collisions), and makes it harder to hack chanops using netsplits.
It was first introduced on <a href="http://www.undernet.org">Undernet</a>.

<p>
With TS, when a nickname collision occurs, only the most recently 
introduced nick is killed. There are two exceptions to this: if if they 
were introduced exactly at the same time, or the collision occurs 
between a TS and a non-TS server then both are killed, and if the
user@hosts are the same, then only the oldest is killed.

<p>
For channels, TS servers keep track of the creation time for channels,
and on a net-join they will only keep ops on the older side if the times
differ, unless the older side has no ops at all.  This is accomplished
using timestamped channel descriptions, which makes all the servers take
the same decisions rather than bouncing MODEs back as is done on
Undernet.

<p>
Since TS was introduced on EFnet when the network was already large,
existing channels without a TS had to be accomodated; channels with a TS
of 0 act like on old non-TS servers.  This makes TS on channels quite
ineffective on a mixed net.  A previous version which was more
'aggressive' was found to be unstable.

<p>
The current version of the TS code and protocol, TS3, fixes a race 
condition that affected channels being created only on part of the net;
it also introduces new warnings, and makes compatibility with non-TS
servers optional.

<a name="specs"></a><h2>Specifications</h2>

<p>
Read the complete specifications of version 3 of the TS protocol in <a
href="protocol.html"> HTML format</a>, or in <a href="protocol">plain
text.</a>

<p>
And here are the specifications for <a href="README.TS4">version 4 of
the protocol</a>, available only in text format (sorry!).

<a name="imp"></a><h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>
The TS base code is implemented on top of a clean ircd2.8.21
distribution.  This is meant as a reference to be ported to +CS, +th,
+hybrid and other versions, not as actual code to use on EFnet.

<ul>
<li>
You can download the full TSora code in the form of a patch file against
a stock ircd2.8.21 distribution: <a href="TSora.diff">[TSora.diff]</a>.

<li>
Or you can download the whole ircd2.8.21+TSora distribution: <a 
href="irc2.8.21+TSora3.tar.gz"> [irc2.8.21+TSora3.tar.gz]</a>. 
</ul>

<p>
TS code is included in all the EFnet ircd versions currently available,
including +CS and +hybrid.  Look at the /version string to see if a 
server includes the TS3 code.  If it does, it will show "TS3" (or
"TS3o" or "TS3ow"...) instead of just "TS" at the end of the version
string.

<a name="patches"></a><h2>Patches</h2>

Since the original TS implementation, a number of bugs have been found,
some in the TS code itself and some in the stock ircd code.  These
patches have been integrated with the current version of ircd+TSora,
but are provided here for completeness.

<p>
Old patches:
<ul>
<li>Patch against <a href="channel.post">spurious server deops with
multiple splits</a> (found by slackie):
<a href="channel.diff">[channel.diff]</a>.
<li>Patch to fix a race condition in NICK handling (reported by
Taner): <a href="s_user.diff">[s_user.diff]</a>.
<li>Patch against a desynch when all ops get nick killed (reported by Core):
<a href="channel.newdiff">[channel.newdiff]</a>.
<li>Patch against a bug (affecting both TS and non-TS servers) in NICK
handling: <a href="s_user.newdiff">[s_user.newdiff]</a>.
<li>Patch against a bug (affecting both TS and non-TS servers) in MODE +k
handling: <a href="channel.diff-keybug">[channel.diff-keybug]</a>
<li>Patch against another bug in NICK handling (reported by ComStud):
<a href="s_user.diff.3">[s_user.diff.3]</a>.
<li>Patch to upgrade a +CSr29 server to TS3: <a
href="CSr29-TS3.diff">CSr29-TS3.diff</a> (use CSr30.5 instead).
<li>Patch to upgarde a 2.8.21+TSora server to TS3: <a 
href="TSora3.diff">[TSora3.diff]</a>
</ul>

<a name="debug"></a><h2>Debugging</h2>

<p>
For debugging of the TS servers, compile them with the option -DTSDEBUG,
which adds a command ("TS") to dump all the known TS's. Servers
compiled with -DTSDEBUG should <em>never</em> be linked to a real net,
as they let anyone get a list of all nicks and channels.

<p>
The TS3 code introduces one new debugging options: TS_WARNINGS.  If
enabled, situations like servers doing MODE +o changes (which should
never happen on an all-TS net) or users remotely JOINing instead of
SJOINing an empty channel (which causes the bug that brought TS3), are
flagged to +s users.

<a name="history"></a><h2>History</h2>

<p>
Timestamping was first introduced on Undernet when it had a few hundred users;
their protocol is described in <a href="Undernet-TS">this document</a>.

<p>
Around December 95, a large number of EFnet IRC admins showed <a 
href="lets-do-TS">interest</a> in introducing a TimeStamp protocol for 
EFnet servers, to reduce the problems caused by collides and channel 
op-hacking.

<p>
After some <a href="announcement">discussion</a> on operlist, I wrote the
specifications and the patches to the server code to add TimeStamping to the
EFnet IRC protocol.  The third version of this protocol is now in use on
EFnet.
