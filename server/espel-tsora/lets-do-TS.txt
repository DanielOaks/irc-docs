Ok people..  after ruffling everyone's feathers, I have decided to take
down the channel.un service (the UN bot will go back to being a normal
channel bot as it was before). The results of "voting" were in favor
of a channel-service, those who voted against one were out numbered.

I have taken the service down because I think TS is a better solution
to our problems. I hope we don't need to vote on whether to use
TS or not.

Can we make a TS (patch) that is compatible with non-TS servers? I'd
like to see something on the table within the next few weeks at least.

If people are going to sit on their butts again and let this thing
go without doing anything, I will consider bringing the channel
service back up since a majority of those who voted were for it. I'd
rather not do this, I'd rather see TS.

Those wanting to help with the move to TS, please subscribe to the
emailing ircd2-patches@kei.com by emailing ircd2-patches-request@kei.com
with the word SUBSCRIBE in the subject of the message. We need people
who will code the patches and people who will help plan the installation
and MOVE.

Thanks to the numerous people who supported my efforts by letting me
know in private email, I appreciate it and am glad to see that I'm not
the only one who is sick of trying to operate a broken protocol.

LET'S DO IT! TS IS COMING! TS IS COMING!
