# On the meaning of "TS6ow"

<grawity> jilles: I'm curious what "ow" means in the "TS:ow" or "TS6ow"
	in the version strings
<@jilles> grawity, pretty much obsolete -- o = TS only, w = TS warnings
	(when a non-TS server is connected remotely)
<@jilles> the warnings are long gone but the 'w' has stayed

# On the meaning of "TS3ora"

<sdaugherty> relaative chans was roger's earlier proposal that was never
	fully built
<mogri> RogerY as in author of OPAS and Austhex?
<sdaugherty> vchans was the actual implementation of relative chans, but
	relative chans was envisioned to have servcerside ignore emulating
	channel modes.
<sdaugherty> no, roger as in TS3ora
<sdaugherty> Efnet's original TS implementation IIRC
<sdaugherty> roger espel llima I think
<mogri> aha, yes
<mogri> well, the 'ora' comes from orabidoo

("orabidoo" appears to be Roger Espel Llima's nickname)
