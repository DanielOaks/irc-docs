## Charybdis
    url: <http://www.atheme.org/project/charybdis>
    base: ratbox 2.1.5+datadrain (+ ircu 2.11)

    "Charybdis is originally based on ratbox 2.0, with some additional code
    from ircu 2.11, but a large number of features from Charybdis were
    integrated back into ratbox with ratbox 3, and ircu 2.12, and contributions
    are contributed bi-directionally on a regular basis."

## TR-IRCD
    <http://tr-ircd.sourceforge.net/>
    <http://web.archive.org/web/20030419112157/http://tr-ircd.net/>
    base: Bahamut 1.4.29 → TR-IRCD 4.x
    rebase: ircd-hybrid 7 → TR-IRCD 5.0

    "The TR-IRCd Project started in 1999 to provide one Turkish IRC server
    (IRCTR) with a more suitable IRC daemon. Yusuf, who was himself an
    IRC-Operator on this network started with modifying Bahamut 1.4, adding a
    IP hiding algorithm and some enhancements to provide operators a better
    control over the Network."

    "After the initial release Yusuf started a Sourceforge Project opening the
    IRCd to the wide public. At this time Ekim joined the team, mostly for
    suggestions and shell scripting but also for minor coding issues. So when
    in Autumn 2001 the second major release TR-IRCd 4.0 came out, the IRCd got
    used on another Turkish IRC Network (TTNet)."

    "Some bug fixes soon resulted in releases of minor version upgrades, some
    of them including new features, mostly adapted from Bahamut. The final
    release was TR-IRCd 4.3 after which a release freeze was announced..."

    "The development moved over to the new upcoming and completely rewritten
    TR-IRCd 5.0 which unites many of the best features of Bahamut and Hybrid
    and our own new ideas..."

## ircd-seven

## tethys
    <https://github.com/atheme/tethys>

    "there are a few reasons why it is desirable to replace charybdis:

      - it does not integrate will into the rest of the atheme platform due to
        being a ratbox fork, i.e. we decided to follow ratbox upstream and work
        with them on libratbox, meaning that we have our own libmowgli and
        there is also this libratbox thing and there's a lot of feature
        overlap...
      - bitrot from changes to changes to changes to 2.8.21 code, which is not
        well understood in terms of side effects, etc.
      - legal issues with the ratbox/hybrid-7 origin of charybdis, including:
          - diane bruce's decision to strip copyrights from headers, giving us
            very little idea of the origin of most 2.8.21 code ("ircd
            contributors past and present")
          - multiple licenses used in the code (GPLv1, GPLv2, BSD-likes), some
            authors no longer being alive to relicense their code to BSD-like
            or allowing an exception to allow openssl to be linked against it
          - binary redistributions of charybdis linked to openssl are illegal
            because of the above
      - many components of mowgli (VIO, for example) were designed with the
        intention of replacing charybdis"
