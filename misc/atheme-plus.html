	<h1>What Atheme+ is/will be</h1>
	<p>
		Atheme+ is an exciting new service that will be offered by atheme.org's IRC activity for users of the Atheme IRC platform.  This document is intended to explain
		what Atheme+ is, what it will eventually do, as well as attempt to dispel myths about it.
	</p>
	<h2>Current problems with IRC identity management</h2>
	<p>
		IRC, including public-facing networks running the Atheme IRC platform, is generally fragmented and lacks infrastructure for maintaining identity across multiple
		networks.  Such a lack of centralised identity-verification services causes a significant problem for extending IRC with semantic information about users people
		are interacting with via IRC.
	</p>
	<p>
		Atheme+ solves this issue by providing cross-network identity validation and management for all individuals using Atheme-based networks.  It accomplishes this by:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>taking advantage of new Atheme 7 features such as <strong>unique entity identifiers</strong> (UEIDs) and mapping them to <strong>Atheme+ network entities</strong>:
		    <ul>
			<li>consider two networks, StaticBox and freenode.</li>
			<li>on StaticBox, your account's UEID is AAY781EZQ.</li>
			<li>on freenode, your account's UEID is HGYAEZ87D.</li>
			<li>
			    Atheme+ can correlate both of these accounts to a known Atheme+ account and denote that data in NickServ INFO output:
			    <blockquote>
				<code>-NickServ- Atheme+ ID: nenolod@dereferenced.org</code>
			    </blockquote>
			</li>
		     </ul>
		</li>
		<li>providing synchronization of account settings, ensuring a consistent user experience across all networks linked to an Atheme+ ID</li>
		<li>providing synchronization of channel settings, ensuring a consistent channel ACL across all networks linked to an Atheme+ ID:
		    <ul>
			<li>like in our previous example, consider two networks, StaticBox and freenode.</li>
			<li>on StaticBox, you have founder-level access on #atheme as Atheme+ mapped UEID: StaticBox:AAY781EZQ.</li>
			<li>on freenode, you have founder-level access on #atheme as Atheme+ mapped UEID: freenode:HGYAEZ87D.</li>
			<li>now consider another account registered to both networks, as StaticBox:YZN2AENCZ and freenode:XEZAN71E5.</li>
			<li>because you have founder-level access to #atheme on both networks, Atheme+ will give channel access to both
			    StaticBox:YZN2AENCZ and freenode:XEZAN71E5 when you change flags on either network because Atheme+ knows that
			    it is the same person.</li>
		    </ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Current problems with IRC and the web</h2>
	<p>
		While Atheme's XMLRPC API server has enabled the creation of a large ecosystem of applications designed to integrate with Atheme,
		(such as Iris, Atheme-Web, phpAtheme and EGS,) many of the applications are cumbersome to configure or provide an incomplete user experience.
	</p>
	<p>
		Atheme+ solves this issue by providing a consistent UI for managing all accounts linked to an Atheme+ identity, which allows for
		plug-and-play web integration.
	</p>
	<h2>Current problems with discovering IRC content</h2>
	<p>
		While IRC search engines, such as <a href="http://www.searchirc.com/">SearchIRC</a> and <a href="http://www.ircdriven.com">IRCDriven</a>
		provide a fairly decent way of discovering content, the actual experience is rather poor, and depends on indexing bots.
	</p>
	<p>
		Atheme+ solves this issue through an optional statistics-push module, which provides channel lists and other general information about
		a network, updated in near-realtime.  Additionally, the statistics-push module can provide information like URL to a qwebirc/iris instance
		for optimal integration of new users into the network.
	</p>
	<h2>Dispeling myths</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Atheme+ is not OPT-IN</strong>: in reality, you don't have to use Atheme+ at all, networks do not have to use it either, and
		    if networks/users don't want to use Atheme+, then things continue as they always have.</li>
		<li><strong>Atheme+ is a security risk</strong>: honestly, not really. the people who designed Atheme, and Atheme+ have considerable experience
		    in the information security field.  using Atheme+ is no more risky than using the XMLRPC server.</li>
		<li><strong>Atheme+ will allow spammers to register resources on my network without using them</strong>: Atheme+ doesn't have any facility for
		    pre-registering a channel.</li>
		<li><strong>Atheme+ will have an Anope 1.9 module</strong>: this may or may not happen depending on how successful it is on Atheme networks.
		    Integration would be somewhat limited with Anope networks, but we will see what we can do.</li>
	</ul>
