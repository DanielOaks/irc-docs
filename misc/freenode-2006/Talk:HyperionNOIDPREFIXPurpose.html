<p>Hi all. I was a little surprised to see that the subject of this change had come up again, over a month after the RFC period expired. We tried to point people to the draft proposal for comments (it was mentioned in a freenode site news item about the hyperion changes, as well as being mentioned in notices to the users online and in the topic of #freenode). But it's great to see discussion of any concerns you may have.
</p><p>The developer wiki doesn't generally host extended policy discussions, so I've set up a wiki article which specifically talks about the purpose and intended use of NOIDPREFIX on freenode, and this is probably the best place for comments. Please feel free to read the article and comment below. Thanks! -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Lilo" title="User:Lilo">User:Lilo</a>

This change is idiotic. Why in the world is this needed? Why not just have the main page here? If it wasn't linked from Freenode.org I'd do it. Sneh. -- Anon.

<i><a href="/wiki/index.php/HyperionNOIDPREFIXPurpose" title="HyperionNOIDPREFIXPurpose">HyperionNOIDPREFIXPurpose</a> talks about the reasons for the change in detail, and I'd invite you to read it and voice your specific concerns and comments. -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Lilo" title="User:Lilo">User:Lilo</a> 17:56, 11 Oct 2005</i>

We were just having a discussion about this in #wikimedia, a number of users are strongly against it and I'm inclined to agree with them. Some Wikimedia sysadmins have experience in running IRC networks, and would be happy to do so again if a fork became necessary due to differences of opinion on policy. I'll invite other Freenode users to express their opinion here. -- <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=User:TimStarling&amp;action=edit" class="new" title="User:TimStarling">TimStarling</a> 11:11, 10 Oct 2005 (CDT)

<i>Certainly it's Wikimedia Foundation's decision, not PDPC's, whether to use freenode or some other network, and it's beyond the scope of this discussion to address any internal reasons you might have to make such a change. All I can do is address the impact of NOIDPREFIX. I believe that it is not as "high-impact" as it may first seem. The change is most likely to be disconcerting to long-time users and administrators of traditional IRC services, and I would assume that most Wikipedia users and contributors don't fall into that category. For those who do find it disconcerting, I would point out that the only real differences are:</i>
</p>
<ol><li> <i>An extra character, a tilde, on the beginning of unregistered nicknames, and</i>
</li><li> <i>More uniqueness in registered nicknames.</i>
</li></ol>
<p><i>Client compatibility has been tested extensively, and we haven't seen a lot of issues. While it's certainly true that there will be some conflicts between existing users with special characters in their IRC nicknames, we're in no hurry to make the change. There's time to resolve quite a few conflicts before a changeover schedule is even solidified.</i>
</p><p><i>Why is the change being made? Based on over a decade of experience with IRC, one of the problems in providing a serious, ongoing discussion service comes from IRC's lack of strong identity assertion. When there's a clear correlation between users and their identities, the user name provides a consistent hook for user reputation, and users are more likely to take the effect of their behavior on their reputations seriously. This makes for more civilized and responsible interaction. I believe that Wikipedia itself has seen a similar effect, where registered users are much less likely to engage in vandalism than unregistered users.</i>
</p><p><i>In each case where freenode has made some change which results in a more direct link between IRC nickname and identity, or makes the effect of behavior on reputation more consistently visible (such as the implementation of DALnet-style services or the creation of group cloaks), the behavior of users in channel settings has been affected in a positive way. The <a href="http://partiallystapled.com/wiki/index.php/HyperionNOIDPREFIXPurpose" class='external' title="http://partiallystapled.com/wiki/index.php/HyperionNOIDPREFIXPurpose" rel="nofollow">base article</a><span class='urlexpansion'>&nbsp;(<i>http://partiallystapled.com/wiki/index.php/HyperionNOIDPREFIXPurpose</i>)</span> discusses how NOIDPREFIX functions in a policy setting and how it supports a stronger assertion of identity.</i>
</p><p><i>We'd be glad to view, and to respond to, any comments you or other users may have on specific problems with the feature. -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Lilo" title="User:Lilo">User:Lilo</a> 17:56, 11 Oct 2005</i>

I <b>really</b> wouldn't like to lose my current nick... -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mark_Bergsma" class='extiw' title="Wikipedia:User:Mark Bergsma">mark-</a>
</p><p><br />
<i>While 75% of our connected sessions use nicknames without any special characters, clearly there will be conflicts in that remaining 25%. NOIDPREFIX does improve the uniqueness of IRC nicknames, it would be hard to do that without <b>some</b> conflicts. But freenode staffers are ready to do everything we can to reduce the impact of any change on the users. We may be able to help you keep your nickname, though that won't be true for everyone affected by the change.</i>
</p><p><i>Several strategies for selecting replacement nicknames, where needed, present themselves. Variants of CamelCaps (e.g., TimeStarling, pinPoint) are already quite popular and are a way to eliminate embedded special characters. Changing from a non-realname-based IRC nickname to a realname-based nickname can be quite effective.</i>
</p><p><i>Internet users often find that, when registering for an online service or when setting up a employee user account, they can't get the exact account name they'd prefer. Returning to one of the usernames you've picked as an alternative in one of those situations can work well. Or sometimes a small change from your present nick ("good" to "bueno" or "buon", "freddy" to "fred", etc.) may be all that's needed. -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Lilo" title="User:Lilo">User:Lilo</a> 17:56, 11 Oct 2005</i>

I think the intended change has a significant number of negative externalities associated with it, the costs of which would be borne by Freenode users at large. The management seems to perpetually downplay the full ramifications of such changes rather extensively, as they do with all their significant proposed changes; I fear this may be percieved negatively by some users, and may alienate the community. I also question whether or not there is general community support for the installation of such a capability, and suspect that there will be a much more significant backlash against it than is perhaps anticipated by Freenode staff. Its planned installation just seems unwise to me: progressive, perhaps, but unwise. - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Fennec" class='extiw' title="Wikipedia:User:Fennec">User:Fennec</a> 11:17, 10 Oct 2005 (CDT)
</p><p><br />
<i>I would be interested in hearing about specific problems which specific people see with the change. Again, based on my experience, the users who are most likely to find the change disconcerting are long-time IRC users and administrators. Freenode as a network draws its users from FOSS and similar projects, from technological organizations, from web media projects and from the general public. Since we're a support and coordination network, other IRC networks are not our main source of new users.</i>
</p><p><i>Internet users are much more likely to have used instant messaging clients in the past than to have used IRC. IM users are all registered users, and IM user names don't generally contain special characters. IM users are likely to have already had to select unique alphanumeric user names in the past in order to use their instant messaging services of choice; indeed, selecting a unique name from a namespace used by under one hundred thousand people will probably be a lot less challenging than selecting one from a namespace used by several million. Further, IM users are unlikely to have specific expectations with respect to service, nor are users who have never used an IM client <b>or</b> an IRC client. So it's hard to see specific negative externalities associated with this change, other than some initial conflict with usernames. But we'd like to hear about whatever you see as a problem. -- <a href="/wiki/index.php/User:Lilo" title="User:Lilo">User:Lilo</a> 17:56, 11 Oct 2005</i>
