<a name="High_traffic_mode"></a><h3>High traffic mode</h3>
<pre> 15:23 &lt; BearPerson&gt; Hmm. Idea: services automatically set a High Traffic Mode number
 15:24 &lt; BearPerson&gt; 0: normal use
 15:24 &lt; BearPerson&gt; 1: ChanServ welcome messages and similar cease
 15:24 &lt; BearPerson&gt; 2: ChanServ autovoice/ops and similar cease, still available on /msg's
 15:25 &lt; BearPerson&gt; 3: All regular user requests are met with "Services are currently overloaded, please try again later.", only ops can use them
 15:30 -!- jonez [~jam@jonez.user] has quit [Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)]
 15:30 -!- jonez [~jam@24-177-225-251.dhcp.spbg.sc.charter.com] has joined #freenode-registry
 16:31 &lt; jilles&gt; BearPerson, you want to limit the "Services are currently overloaded" messages as well
 16:31 &lt; jilles&gt; when it's beyond the limit, drop the lusers' commands silently
 16:31 &lt; BearPerson&gt; ah, right
 16:31 &lt; BearPerson&gt; but users probably have a right to know what's going on
 16:31 &lt; BearPerson&gt; but then again, services will just have "crashed" for them
 16:32 &lt; jilles&gt; ratbox-services limits commands in such a way, but never voluntarily stops autoop/autovoice et cetera
 16:32 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah
 16:32 &lt; jilles&gt; of course new users will probably not be able to log in if there's high load
 16:33 &lt; BearPerson&gt; though I'd think it better to be able to log on and request voice than to not be able to log on at all but get auto-voice if I were logged on&nbsp;:)
 16:33 &lt; jilles&gt; one can wonder what's the use of taking this so far as services only responding to opers
 16:34 &lt; jilles&gt; perhaps it's better to just accept services has been flooded off and will drop out
 16:34 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah
 16:34 &lt; jilles&gt; then again, the first part of this project is the web part
 16:34 &lt; jilles&gt; not the part that connects to ircd
 16:34 &lt; BearPerson&gt; which is kind of interesting
 16:35 &lt; BearPerson&gt; the web part is only read-only lookups in the database, right?
 16:53 &lt; GXTi&gt; no
 16:53 &lt; GXTi&gt; all channel info is managed through the web
 16:55 &lt; BearPerson&gt; user info too?
 16:55 &lt; GXTi&gt; yes.
</pre>
<a name="Cloaks"></a><h3>Cloaks</h3>
<pre> 16:55  * BearPerson wonders if it would be worth to have a CloakServ where the user can choose from different cloaks given to him
 16:55 &lt; BearPerson&gt; then you'd have a solution for people in multiple groups
 16:57 &lt; BearPerson&gt; instead of giving them cloaks of "foobar.active-supporter-pdpc.sourcemage.kde.foo"
 16:57 &lt; BearPerson&gt; the staffers would just add a cloak to CloakServ's list for that user... the user could set any cloak he/she wants
 16:58 &lt; BearPerson&gt; from the ones on the list
 17:35 &lt; lilo&gt; it should be easy enough for people to be given a choice
 17:36 &lt; BearPerson&gt; sounds like the easiest maintainable method to me
 17:36 &lt; BearPerson&gt; opers can add/remove cloaks
 17:36 &lt; BearPerson&gt; users can choose which one to use (or none)
 17:37 &lt; BearPerson&gt; random would be interesting&nbsp;:)
 17:37 &lt; Alex&gt; Hmm, I thought you were hoping to use a different system to show project involvement?
 17:37 &lt; BearPerson&gt; Isn't the group contact saying so enough?
 17:37 &lt; BearPerson&gt; required and sufficient?
 17:45 &lt; lilo&gt; well, there are several ways to go about this
 17:45 &lt; lilo&gt; additional lines on WHOIS
 17:45 &lt; lilo&gt; a cloak
 17:45 &lt; lilo&gt; if the protocol isn't irc, you might even be able to present a different cloak per channel
 17:45 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah
 17:46 &lt; lilo&gt; there's no reason not to employ multiple approaches as far as that goes
 17:46 &lt; BearPerson&gt; so, would maintenance of these cloaks and stuff be preferably done by IRC -&gt; services, by the web interface, or by something else entirely?
 17:46 &lt; lilo&gt; preferably by the web interface I think
 17:47 &lt; Alex&gt; I was thinking the additional lines in whois.
 17:47 &lt; lilo&gt; this is the sort of thing people use web interfaces to do
 17:47  * lilo nods at Alex 
 17:47 &lt; Alex&gt; lilo: Think there should be some sort of 'alternate' method of +o?
 17:47 &lt; lilo&gt; but that's not to say we wouldn't provide XML-RPC or SOAP interfaces
 17:47 &lt; Alex&gt; lilo: Say, you've got channel moderators, and you've also got a mode which defines involvement?
 17:47 &lt; lilo&gt; Alex: well, opping is something you probably want the irc-based component to be able to do
 17:47 &lt; Alex&gt; lilo: Leave mods as +o, but make people involved not cloaked, per say, but.. $, *, whatever?
 17:48 &lt; lilo&gt; hmmm, I dunno how fancy we want to ultimately get
 17:48 &lt; Alex&gt; I'm thinking less fancy, more.. thorough&nbsp;:-)
 17:48  * lilo is a bit tired and may not be tracking well
 17:48 &lt; lilo&gt; back in a sec
 17:50 &lt; BearPerson&gt; so people would be identified in some way in the project's main channel?
 17:50 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm. A whois info "Is involved with: foobar (contact), goo (lead), zoul (sublead), moo (developer), nano (user)"
 17:51 &lt; BearPerson&gt; it'd give info on the project and the status
 17:51 &lt; BearPerson&gt; we definitely need a /msg NickServ whois &lt;nick&gt;
 17:51 &lt; Alex&gt; BearPerson: Yeah, that kinda idea. Maybe a umode on chan just to show involvement, make it easier for users to contact devs..
 17:52 &lt; BearPerson&gt; show involvement and maybe type
 17:53 &lt; Alex&gt; Hmm, that'd be more difficult with the modes, but pretty good with your idea..
 17:53 &lt; BearPerson&gt; kindof the "user, developer, leader" ladder thing
 17:53 &lt; BearPerson&gt; so you know... if you want generic support, a user will do
 17:53 &lt; Alex&gt; This would require serious involvements from the projects, tho..
 17:53 &lt; Alex&gt; Ie, submission of group contacts, creation of levels, assignment..
 17:53 &lt; Alex&gt; Something that many groups just don't do.
 17:53 &lt; BearPerson&gt; well, they don't have to do it
 17:53 &lt; BearPerson&gt; it'd just be a feature we offer
 17:54 &lt; Alex&gt; Hmm, true. It'd be nice, though
 17:55 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah
 17:55  * lilo notes that the new interface will replace the existing services interface
 17:55 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I wonder if many IRC clients would do anything with the mode though
 17:55 &lt; lilo&gt; not every group will need to set cloaks, but all of them will be able to do so directly
 17:55 &lt; BearPerson&gt; will cloaks not need a staffer's involvement?
 17:56 &lt; BearPerson&gt; might lead to slight abuse/chaos
 17:56 &lt; lilo&gt; tld assignment will need staff involvement
 17:56 &lt; lilo&gt; but after that, it's all on the projects
 17:56 &lt; BearPerson&gt; Hmm... I think the special modes are a nice idea
 17:57 &lt; BearPerson&gt; though you wouldn't really see them much
 17:57 &lt; BearPerson&gt; most clients probably just support +o, +v and maybe +h
 17:57 &lt; BearPerson&gt; or whatever half-op was
 17:57 &lt; Alex&gt; BearPerson: Define most?
 17:57 &lt; BearPerson&gt; never quite checked
 17:57 &lt; BearPerson&gt; but I'm rather sure if we start making some up almost none will display it nicely
 17:58 &lt; Alex&gt; BearPerson: Whilst angeles was working on xrcd, he had to use several different types of modes.. I think he ended up with ~, %, *, &amp;, *, @, +, 0..
 17:58 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah, but prepending an @ is the client, not the server
 17:58 &lt; BearPerson&gt; so the client would be responsible for marking e.g. a developer as ~nick
 17:59 &lt; jilles&gt; BearPerson, nope
 17:59 &lt; Alex&gt; I don't have enough authority to speak on the subject, I am but a mere user..
 17:59 &lt; BearPerson&gt; we'd mangle messages?
 17:59 &lt; jilles&gt; in some cases, the client&lt;-&gt;server and server&lt;-&gt;server protocols use @ and +
 17:59 &lt; BearPerson&gt; Alex, as am I&nbsp;:)
 17:59 &lt; jilles&gt; for example, WHO, WHOIS, SJOIN
 18:00 &lt; jilles&gt; and NAMES
 18:00 &lt; BearPerson&gt; true, yeah
 18:00 &lt; BearPerson&gt; Yeah, that might just be something we could use
 18:01 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I'd say that these modes shouldn't be set by ChanServ but rather by CloakServ or GroupServ or whatever
 18:02 &lt; Alex&gt; I thought Servs were being abandoned? 
 18:02 &lt; Alex&gt; Or is it jsut the interface?
 18:02 &lt; BearPerson&gt; erm.... just noticed.... we're not just re-writing services... we'd be adding to ircd as well
 18:02 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I wonder... how would you do authentification without NickServ&nbsp;?
 18:03 &lt; jilles&gt; /&lt;someotherservicesshortcut&gt; &lt;someothercommand&gt; &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt;
 18:03 &lt; BearPerson&gt; and dancer-ircd sure has a lot of fine-grained permissions and stuff... but having an intelligent OperServ is probably still a help
 18:03 &lt; jilles&gt; or with enough integration, as a server password
</pre>
<a name="Decentralized_services"></a><h3>Decentralized services</h3>
<pre> 18:03 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah, right
 18:04 &lt; BearPerson&gt; why not make it an IRC command, yeah
 18:04 &lt; BearPerson&gt; why the /msg NickServ workaround
 18:04 &lt; BearPerson&gt; s/workaround/overhead/
 18:04 &lt; jilles&gt; because it must fit in the framework
 18:05 &lt; BearPerson&gt; true again
 18:05 &lt; jilles&gt; also many users may find it easier if they don't have to learn additional commands
 18:05 &lt; Alex&gt; Perhaps introduce transparent mapping?
 18:05 &lt; BearPerson&gt; this would almost allow decentralized services... almost
 18:05 &lt; Alex&gt; Heh.. we could do mesh, too!
 18:05  * Alex grins 
 18:06 &lt; jilles&gt; there's nothing preventing a services nick to be introduced at another point if the first services failed
 18:06 &lt; jilles&gt; but it still has to be synced somehow
 18:06 &lt; jilles&gt; such as a single database
 18:06 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah
 18:07 &lt; Alex&gt; jilles: What was the problem with the decentralised on xrcd. Local exploit?
 18:07 &lt; BearPerson&gt; so we're rather loose about the entire *Serv makeup... good
 18:08 &lt; jilles&gt; Alex, wasn't that the syncing?
 18:08 &lt; Alex&gt; jilles: I think so.. man, registry is alot like xrcd, isn't it?&nbsp;:P
 18:09 &lt; BearPerson&gt; except that we're not trying to integrate it into ircd (yet)&nbsp;;-)
 18:09 &lt; Alex&gt;&nbsp;;)
 18:10 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm... I'm starting to understand the wiki page more fully
</pre>
<a name="Ticketing"></a><h3>Ticketing</h3>
<pre> 18:10 &lt; BearPerson&gt; what's "ticket services" and "volunteer scheduling" though?
 18:10 &lt; Alex&gt; I queried that.
 18:10 &lt; Alex&gt; I imagine ticketing systems..
 18:11 &lt; BearPerson&gt; meaning?
 18:11 &lt; Alex&gt;  ticket may be a pick-up ticket, for example when retrieving clothing from a dry cleaning shop or an automobile from a repair shop. It is also used in places where people are required to "take a number" to queue up, such as in a waiting room or at a customer service desk. Often, this simply has a number printed on it.
 18:12 &lt; Alex&gt; Think 'queue for support'
 18:12 &lt; Alex&gt; I might be off, but that's what ticket service says to me.
 18:13 &lt; BearPerson&gt; "# Ticket tracking with real time notification on and off the freenode network, tightly-coupled to volunteer scheduling services.
 18:13 &lt; BearPerson&gt; # 24/7 volunteer scheduling services."
 18:13 &lt; Alex&gt; Yay, I was right&nbsp;;)
 18:13 &lt; Alex&gt; The volunteer thing, no idea about that. Possible extension of the catalyst system?
 18:15 &lt; BearPerson&gt; maybe something like "from 3-5 am GMT, zero_the_hero is doing support in #sourcemage
 18:15 &lt; Alex&gt; Ugh, hope not..&nbsp;;)
 18:15 &lt; Alex&gt; (jk)
 18:16 &lt; BearPerson&gt; wouldn't see such a scheduling as needed though
 18:17 &lt; Alex&gt; Maybe a bit of feedback could stop the wild stabbing in the dark..&nbsp;;)
 18:18  * BearPerson stabs lilo
 18:18 &lt; BearPerson&gt; he probably has highlights turned off, must be pretty busy
 18:19  * BearPerson stabs jilles instead
 18:19 &lt; Alex&gt; I think he's gone for a nap. No worries.
 20:29  * lilo looks in
 20:29 &lt; lilo&gt; incident tracking
 20:30 &lt; lilo&gt; I can tweak the wording
 20:30 &lt; lilo&gt; volunteer scheduling services is initially primarily for the freenode staff project
 20:31 &lt; lilo&gt; having someone around when you need them to handle user problems and network problems
 20:32 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I see
 20:33 &lt; BearPerson&gt; ticketing being "Have a problem? Get a ticket, as soon as someone is available we'll search half the web to notify you"&nbsp;?
 20:34 &lt; jonez&gt; ticketing, if done correctly, is a very useful tool, especially for "long term" issue resolution.
 20:34 &lt; BearPerson&gt; ah
 20:35 &lt; BearPerson&gt; you have some way of contacting someone when the problem gets solved?
 20:36 &lt; jonez&gt; that, and being able to take notes regarding who helped resolve the issue.
 20:37  * lilo nods
 20:37 &lt; lilo&gt; ticket tracking is incident tracking
 20:37 &lt; lilo&gt; users file incidents, we notify someone and they resolve the problem
 20:37 &lt; lilo&gt; volunteer scheduling is keeping track of who's around
 20:38 &lt; lilo&gt; and flagging them to receive real time notifications from the incident tracking system
 20:38 &lt; lilo&gt; and escalating if there's no response within some appropriate time interval
 20:38 &lt; jonez&gt; not to mention "escalation" if a ticket sits around unclaimed for a while..
 20:38 &lt; lilo&gt; depending on the problem, turnaround might need to be very short or a longer turnaround might be acceptable
 20:38  * lilo nods
 20:39 &lt; jonez&gt; at ans.net we had a "problem severity" field.. class 1 was the highest level and would escalate the fastest.
 20:39 &lt; jonez&gt; class 4, iirc, would not escalate at all, or so slowly that no one noticed.
 20:40 &lt; lilo&gt; I tend to prefer named classes that are largely self-explanatory
 20:40 &lt; lilo&gt; but yeah
 20:40 &lt; jonez&gt; lilo: for the ticketing system, I have a GPL project called "workflow" that you could easily modify to suit your needs.
 20:40 &lt; lilo&gt; workflow.... are you involved with that project?
 20:40  * lilo looks at jonez
</pre>
<a name="Language_follies"></a><h3>Language follies</h3>
<pre> 20:40 &lt; jonez&gt; I am the primary author
 20:40 &lt; lilo&gt; ah&nbsp;:)
 20:41 &lt; lilo&gt; I'm not asking to be dogmatic or anything, but what language is it in?
 20:41  * lilo remembers perl
 20:41 &lt; jonez&gt; php
 20:41  * jonez ducks.
 20:41 &lt; lilo&gt; ah, kay
 20:41 &lt; jonez&gt; but it uses pgsql and pear and I have designed it to be as secure as possible.
 20:41 &lt; lilo&gt; okay, here's what I think
 20:41 &lt; jonez&gt; the original version was in python.
 20:41 &lt; lilo&gt; I've heard good things about workflow&nbsp;;)
 20:41 &lt; jonez&gt; you have?&nbsp;:)
 20:41 &lt; lilo&gt; working with the primary author could be a real benefit&nbsp;;)
 20:42 &lt; lilo&gt; yes
 20:42  * jonez blushes
 20:42 &lt; lilo&gt; let me make sure it's the one I think it is
 20:42 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: btw, I really like pgsql&nbsp;:)
 20:42 &lt; jonez&gt; I love pgsql. I've been using it for years.
 20:44 &lt; lilo&gt; we're using it to track CTCP VERSION statistics, for example, just started doing that
 20:45 &lt; lilo&gt; quarter of a million records in that database
 20:45 &lt; lilo&gt; pgsql just seems to work really nicely
 20:45 &lt; lilo&gt; very scalable
 20:46 &lt; lilo&gt; started midday on the 16th
 20:46 &lt; lilo&gt; (UTC)
 20:46 &lt; lilo&gt; I'm not sure how large we'll let that database get, but I wanted a nice huge snapshot and I knew pgsql could handle it
 20:47 &lt; jonez&gt; indeed.
 20:47 &lt; jonez&gt; pgsql competes *very* well with "big iron" like oracle.
 20:47 &lt; lilo&gt; and it keeps getting better
 20:47 &lt; lilo&gt; good stuff
 20:47 &lt; jonez&gt; yep
 20:48 &lt; jonez&gt; so is the workflow you have heard about *my* workflow?
 20:48 &lt; lilo&gt; now I'm not sure
 20:48 &lt; lilo&gt; I was thinking it was ticket tracking
 20:48 &lt; jonez&gt; well, it is.
 20:48 &lt; lilo&gt; there you go then
 20:48 &lt; jonez&gt; but I have described it as "project tracking" because it has fields that are relevant to that
 20:49 &lt; jonez&gt; I'm the one that has the "workflow" project on freshmeat.net
 20:49  * lilo nods
 20:49 &lt; lilo&gt; what we need to be able to do is provide realtime, 24/7 support
 20:49 &lt; lilo&gt; so far our needs aren't huge
 20:50 &lt; lilo&gt; but we keep growing
 20:50 &lt; lilo&gt; have you looked at the little summary on the wiki?
 20:50 &lt; jonez&gt; well, workflow has been used by a group of 10 people or so.. in "real time"
 20:50 &lt; jonez&gt; uhmm.. ya.
 20:50 &lt; jonez&gt; the only thing I don't know how to do myself is the "scheduling" thing you want.
</pre>
<a name="Volunteer_paging"></a><h3>Volunteer paging</h3>
<pre> 20:50 &lt; lilo&gt; should I try to elaborate a bit?
 20:50 &lt; lilo&gt; yeah
 20:50 &lt; lilo&gt; well, that's kind of a calendar function
 20:50 &lt; lilo&gt; I'm not sure how it should be laid out
 20:50 &lt; lilo&gt; but I know we should be able to define shifts for volunteers
 20:51 &lt; lilo&gt; and have them clock in and out
 20:51 &lt; lilo&gt; so that when a new ticket comes in, the system knows who to notify
 20:51 &lt; lilo&gt; we need several forms of notification, at least in potential
 20:51 &lt; lilo&gt; email, irc client, paging
 20:52 &lt; BearPerson&gt; paging.... lol
 20:52 &lt; jonez&gt; well given that it's all in a database (the tickets I mean), it would be pretty simple to write a query that sends out email (to pagers or to an inbox someplace) from cron.
 20:52 &lt; GXTi&gt; an operwall would do the trick for staff who are online.
 20:52 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: when we get a 1,000-bot clone attack, yeah, we might need paging&nbsp;;)
 20:52 &lt; GXTi&gt; is it common for staff to -o when not in use here?
 20:52 &lt; jonez&gt; I am a bit uncomfortable implementing anything that has "real time" in the description in php.
 20:52 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: not really
 20:52 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: *nod*
 20:52 &lt; GXTi&gt; then an operwall would definately work for anyone actually paying attention to irc.
 20:52 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: but they're not always going to be on IRC
 20:53 &lt; BearPerson&gt; nor will all the problems be on IRC
 20:53 &lt; GXTi&gt; perhaps wire up an autodialer?&nbsp;;)
 20:53 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: and what happens when the shift volunteer has flaked out and it gets escalated to a senior staffer who's not online?
 20:53  * lilo nods
 20:53 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: though we have the internet; we should be able to use it for stuff like that&nbsp;:)
 20:53  * GXTi pets asterisk
 20:54 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I like that picture... getting paged from wherever because the network is under a floodbot attack
 20:54 &lt; BearPerson&gt; that shows a) devotion and b) geekiness
 20:54 &lt; GXTi&gt; hm.
 20:54 &lt; BearPerson&gt;&nbsp;;-)
 20:55 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: well, if you think about it, we're here for a reason
 20:55 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah
 20:55 &lt; BearPerson&gt; and volunteers (except for you&nbsp;!?
 20:55 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: torvalds was unpaid for years; he didn't ignore some corporate entity with a bug because he wasn't paid
 20:55 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah
 20:55 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: well, I'm paid, but not anything impressive 8)
 20:56 &lt; BearPerson&gt; just a matter of how much you're going to do
 20:56 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: something under 1/6 of what I was paid when I was in the Bay area 8)
 20:56 &lt; GXTi&gt; a friendly beep on the cell wouldn't be too awful bad.
 20:56 &lt; GXTi&gt; text messaging, etc for those who have it.
 20:56 &lt; lilo&gt; the thing is, we're going to keep scaling
 20:56 &lt; lilo&gt; that means we'll need new volunteers
 20:56 &lt; lilo&gt; some of them will be great
 20:56 &lt; GXTi&gt; email is too asynchronous, typically people don't have realtime checking.
 20:56 &lt; lilo&gt; and some will be totally unmotivated
 20:56 &lt; BearPerson&gt; my team lead in smgl once said "When people start paying me, that's when I'm going to work by their deadlines"
 20:56 &lt; BearPerson&gt; has some truth in it
 20:56 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: well, there are two ways to look at that
 20:57 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: there are people who naturally care about the operation of the network, and people who don't
 20:57 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I'm not saying it's complete truth
 20:57 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: I can't turn somebody who doesn't care about freenode into somebody who doesn't (at least not reliably 8)
 20:57 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah, I'm not doubting the caring about the network though
 20:57 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: but why would I want to have a volunteer who didn't?
 20:57 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I'm just thinking how much
 20:57 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: typically voluteers do care&nbsp;:)
 20:57 &lt; lilo&gt; right
 20:57  * lilo nods at GXTi 
 20:57 &lt; GXTi&gt; unless they have delusions of payment&nbsp;:P
 20:57 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: well, some do, some don't
 20:58 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: some care a little and some don't care at all
 20:58 &lt; GXTi&gt; that's the beauty of volunteerism.
 20:58 &lt; BearPerson&gt; or rather, how much they're going to sacrifice for it
 20:58 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: nobody is asking a given volunteer to work 24/7 for the network
 20:58 &lt; BearPerson&gt; sacrifice isn't the right word
 20:58 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: an hour a week is great
 20:58 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: if they *do* it
 20:58 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: that's the issue
 20:58 &lt; BearPerson&gt; There might be people who like the pager idea, others may not
 20:59 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: typically, a volunteer on duty is going to be on freenode
 20:59 &lt; GXTi&gt; so it's up to the individual staffer how they want to be notified.
 20:59 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: but what happens if they flake out?
 20:59 &lt; GXTi&gt; though the operwall is somewhat mandatory.
 20:59 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: a senior staffer is going to get notified
 20:59 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: not necessarily
 20:59 &lt; BearPerson&gt; who might be off somewhere
 20:59 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: operwall catches everybody, not the duty volunteers
 20:59 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: yeah
 20:59 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: and actually, I'm not the only person who's paid
 20:59 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: deedra isn't paid by PDPC, but she's paid
 20:59 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: everybody as in _everybody_ or everybody as in all staff online, away or not?
 21:00 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: operwall displays to anybody who has a client open and +z umode
 21:00 &lt; GXTi&gt; i could be mixing up my terminology again, it's not the first time&nbsp;:P
 21:00 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah, I'm wondering...
 21:00 &lt; GXTi&gt; but isn't +z an operator umode?
 21:00 &lt; GXTi&gt; at least there's some filtering.
 21:00 &lt; BearPerson&gt; would it be a good thing or a bad thing to have a bunch of volunteers just "hanging out"
 21:01 &lt; BearPerson&gt; without a fixed schedule, helping out whenever things appear tight
 21:01 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: there's also the issue of who can ssubmit tickets and who is taken most seriously.
 21:01 &lt; BearPerson&gt; and they're watching their monitors/whatever
 21:01 &lt; jonez&gt; BearPerson: well, that's what we have now, isn't it?
 21:01 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: getting beeped at 3am because someone submitted "my pants are on fire!" isn't the best thing ever.
 21:01 &lt; BearPerson&gt; what we have now solely
 21:01 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I'm wondering if we should jump for the opposite completely or have something in between
 21:02 &lt; BearPerson&gt; which is better
 21:02 &lt; BearPerson&gt; maybe having new staffers not in schedule would be good for "warming up"
 21:02 &lt; BearPerson&gt; and then having someone standing by when they are for the first few times might take some pressure too
 21:03 &lt; BearPerson&gt; on the other hand, having people just "lurking" could be called a waste of workforce/time
 21:04 &lt; BearPerson&gt; Hmm... I'm starting to make little sense I think.... maybe I should go and sleep
 21:04 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: actually, you probably want to throw them into the schedule with backup
 21:04 &lt; GXTi&gt; could be passive lurking&nbsp;;p
 21:04 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: and see if they do the work
 21:04 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: it all depends on whether someone has the time or inclination
 21:04 &lt; BearPerson&gt; though the backup shouldn't do all the work (later on)
 21:04 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: $16K/year doesn't really pay me to answer pages, but I do it
 21:05 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: if the newbie volunteer is well-briefed, we pretty much are going to expect them to try to fix the problem first time, or ask for help
 21:05 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: it's not about knowing everything, it's about motivation
 21:05 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: it's not that we insist that everyone be motivated, it's just that those are the people we want to have as volunteers 8)
 21:05 &lt; BearPerson&gt; right&nbsp;:)
 21:06 &lt; BearPerson&gt; unmotivated-for-fixed-schedule might be some help as backup too... would we have that kind of people?
 21:06 &lt; lilo&gt; probably so
 21:06 &lt; lilo&gt; anyone can help
 21:06 &lt; lilo&gt; heck, I've gone out and collared random developers from well-known projects to help in emergencies
 21:07 &lt; BearPerson&gt; although it would mean great support on saturday evening and little on monday morning&nbsp;;-)
 21:07 &lt; lilo&gt; they don't usually code, because they don't have time, but they can keep an eye out
 21:07 &lt; GXTi&gt; "collared", grin&nbsp;:)
 21:07 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hehe, interesting&nbsp;:)
 21:07 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: actually, it varies....some people have late schedules
 21:07 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: we have 25,000+ users and that number is only going to grow
 21:07 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: and they're all over the world
 21:07 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: it's evening somewhere almost any time of day
 21:07 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I can imagine that... ask the project lead "hey, who of these guys do you trust"&nbsp;:)
 21:07 &lt; BearPerson&gt; right
 21:08 &lt; GXTi&gt; and where it's not evening, someone somewhere else is up anyway.
 21:08  * lilo nods
 21:08 &lt; BearPerson&gt; though maybe asia/australia might be a bit understaffed - or that's just my impression
 21:08 &lt; BearPerson&gt; what timezone are you in, by the way, lilo?
 21:08 &lt; lilo&gt; we can get Australia and New Zealand
 21:08 &lt; lilo&gt; Sat May 21 01:08:52 fST 2005
 21:08  * lilo grins
 21:08 &lt; BearPerson&gt; lol
 21:08 &lt; lilo&gt; I'm on freenode Standard Time&nbsp;:)
 21:09 &lt; BearPerson&gt;&nbsp;:)
 21:09 &lt; jonez&gt; aka "UTC"
 21:09 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I know&nbsp;:)
 21:09 &lt; lilo&gt; lately I wake up at 11am, go back to sleep after an hour and get back up around 5pm&nbsp;:)
 21:09 &lt; lilo&gt; and I tend to get to sleep between 6am and 8am
 21:09 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm
 21:10 &lt; BearPerson&gt; so west coast USA?&nbsp;:)
 21:10 &lt; lilo&gt; I'm trying to set things up so I get up at 11am and work until 8pm, with a break or two
 21:10 &lt; GXTi&gt; houston&nbsp;:)
 21:10 &lt; lilo&gt; and then linger on till about 3am
 21:10 &lt; lilo&gt; yes&nbsp;:)
 21:10 &lt; lilo&gt; houston
 21:10 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm... yeah, I got the impression you're around pretty much all the time
 21:10 &lt; lilo&gt; it seems that way
 21:11 &lt; BearPerson&gt; with that schedule&nbsp;:)
 21:11 &lt; lilo&gt; I'm trying to cut down some though, I get eyestrain 8)
 21:11 &lt; BearPerson&gt; 3:11 localtime here&nbsp;:)
 21:11 &lt; BearPerson&gt; am
 21:11 &lt; GXTi&gt; i ran my system on fST for a while.
 21:11 &lt; GXTi&gt; even modified a timezone to say fST in date.
 21:11  * lilo nods
 21:11 &lt; BearPerson&gt; wouldn't be hard for me&nbsp;:)
 21:12 &lt; GXTi&gt; i forget why i went back
 21:12 &lt; lilo&gt; in GNU/Linux, if you set TZ=fST in your env, that's what you get
 21:12 &lt; GXTi&gt; probably the irssi clock.
 21:12 &lt; lilo&gt; any timezone it doesn't recognize is UTC
 21:12 &lt; BearPerson&gt; indeed
 21:12 &lt; GXTi&gt; i used the /etc/localtime way though&nbsp;:)
 21:12 &lt; lilo&gt; freebsd seems to be different
 21:12  * lilo nods
 21:12 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: we should talk more and see if we can put something together
 21:12 &lt; BearPerson&gt; all the way&nbsp;:)
 21:12 &lt; jonez&gt; lilo: ok
</pre>
<a name="More_language_follies"></a><h3>More language follies</h3>
<pre> 21:13 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: why did you switch from python, btw?
 21:13  * lilo always likes to ask about language issues
 21:13 &lt; lilo&gt; people always have reasons, and the reasons are instructive
 21:13 &lt; jonez&gt; cuz I wanted to try out php.. actually, a client insisted I learn it.. and at the time, I had no idea what it would take to make a web app.
 21:14 &lt; lilo&gt; oic, makes sense
 21:14 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm... so it seems that basically most of services will be dropped in favor of a web-interface?
 21:14  * GXTi finds it hard to keep neutral about php.
 21:14 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: are we going to be using mod_python?
 21:14 &lt; jonez&gt; php is by no means perfect&nbsp;:)
 21:14 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: hasn't been nailed down
 21:14 &lt; GXTi&gt; jonez: i'm so used to more complex languages like perl that i just can't stand it really.
 21:15 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: was just down to python when jonez came by and confused matters&nbsp;:)
 21:15 &lt; jonez&gt; GXTi: oh.. perl.. the one that looks like executable line noise!
 21:15  * jonez ducks.
 21:15 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: yes
 21:15 &lt; GXTi&gt; lately i've come to understand that it's written the way it is because it was designed for designers, not programmers. though a new brand of programmers hseems to have sprung up around it.
 21:15 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: there are a lot of reasons for it
 21:15 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I see
 21:15 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: many of them social in nature
 21:15 &lt; GXTi&gt; and muddled it up with more functionality. darn them!&nbsp;:)
 21:15 &lt; BearPerson&gt; ahh
 21:15 &lt; GXTi&gt; i agree with the python choice. it gives me a reason to learn it.
 21:16 &lt; GXTi&gt; it's a great language, i'm just somewhat attached to perl&nbsp;:p
 21:16 &lt; BearPerson&gt; some of them being related to the IRC Traditionalists?&nbsp;:)
 21:16 &lt; jonez&gt; I also agree with the python choice, and I strongly agree with the pgsql choice.
 21:16 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: well, mostly we need to get stuff done 8)
 21:16 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: cool beans
 21:16 &lt; GXTi&gt; it seems python is coming into a position to replace perl, and perl6 isn't going to help that much.
 21:16 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: I'm going to have to sell pgsql to deedra, I think they provide mysql utility machines and don't currently have a pgsql one
 21:16 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: but I really like pgsql, it's impressive
 21:16 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I'll see if/where I can help out... don't have a lot of python experience, but it would be worth it
 21:16 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: cool
 21:17 &lt; GXTi&gt; can't say i have much experience with pgsql, but i learn quickly, and i know little enough about mysql it won't be hard to forget.
 21:17 &lt; jonez&gt; lilo: pardon.. but who is deedra?
 21:17 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: I don't know about perl6
 21:17 &lt; GXTi&gt; jonez: dmwaters
 21:17 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: one of my senior staffers, paid by OSUOSL, which provides a lot of our infrastructure in the US
 21:17 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: not released yet afaik.
 21:17 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: yeah, that's an issue 8)
 21:17 &lt; GXTi&gt; it basically breaks backwards compatibility totally, which scares me.
 21:17 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: though there's pugs 8)
 21:18 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: sometimes you have to break compatibility
 21:18 &lt; GXTi&gt; yes, a lesson php will never learn.
 21:18 &lt; jonez&gt; lilo: ah. as for selling it to her.. perhaps mention something in #postgresql or on one of the mailing lists and get some ammo.
 21:18 &lt; GXTi&gt; but sigh, it's so radically different.
 21:18 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: but I like python partly because it's gotten mature, and partly because it has simple syntax and it's hard to make it horribly unreadable at the statement-and-block level
 21:18  * BearPerson would like to see some detailed document someday on requirements for the registry
 21:18 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: indeed.
 21:18 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: then tell me what you need next&nbsp;;)
 21:18 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: although patchin can be an issue.
 21:18 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: otherwise I will just sit here talking about it&nbsp;:) this is collaboration&nbsp;:)
 21:18 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: we should have a toolset(read: hack) for dealing with that.
 21:18 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hehe
 21:19 &lt; lilo&gt; I have stayed away from python for years because I'm an old fart coder
 21:19 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I think the "Summary" part is a little too short, maybe detailing those out could help getting some ideas on how everything should come together
 21:19 &lt; lilo&gt; I cut my teeth on RPG-II and COBOL and FORTRAN and PL/I on punch cards
 21:19 &lt; lilo&gt; this whole "semantic whitespace" thing bothers me 8)
 21:19 &lt; GXTi&gt; for the admin of the wiki, it's been a while since i've looked at it p
 21:19 &lt; jonez&gt; lilo: eek! you are older than me!&nbsp;:)
 21:20 &lt; BearPerson&gt; like the ticketing isn't quite clear without explanation
 21:20 &lt; lilo&gt; but it's a robust language and the application needs ease of maintenance
 21:20 &lt; BearPerson&gt; and what interface, what reading/writing should go where
 21:20 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: hehe, I know one person off the top of my head who spends time here who is older than I am...hmmm, maybe two 8)
 21:20 &lt; jonez&gt; lilo: I'm under 35, but older than 30
 21:20 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: web interface for incident tracking
 21:20 &lt; BearPerson&gt; "Who can Read/Write What Where"&nbsp;:)
 21:20 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: I'm under 50&nbsp;:) this year 8)
 21:21  * BearPerson is 18&nbsp;:)
 21:21 &lt; lilo&gt; that's the other thing, BearPerson 
 21:21 &lt; jonez&gt; BearPerson: with all due respect, sir, I've been programming longer than you have been alive&nbsp;:)
 21:21 &lt; BearPerson&gt; basically some seperation of what component will be responsible for what
 21:21 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: it needs to be tightly couple to a registration and user account framework which will become the replacement for IRC servers
 21:21 &lt; lilo&gt; erm services
 21:21 &lt; GXTi&gt; drat! lilo _is_ planning to replce irc!
 21:22 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: well, yeah
 21:22 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: a bit at a time
 21:22 &lt; BearPerson&gt; though user account login will probably still have to go by IRC
 21:22 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: but not servers, I mistyped
 21:22 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: services
 21:22 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: yes
</pre>
<a name="Ticketing_revisited"></a><h3>Ticketing revisited</h3>
<pre> 21:22 &lt; jonez&gt; well, it would be cool to have a web *and* irc interface to the ticketing system.
 21:22 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah, would be
 21:22 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: SOAP and XML-RPC
 21:22 &lt; jonez&gt; and maybe a small app in curses and/or gnome
 21:23 &lt; GXTi&gt; the ticketing is more web-sited.
 21:23 &lt; GXTi&gt; suited.
 21:23  * BearPerson wonders if he's sitting alone among opers here&nbsp;:)
 21:23 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: there are reasons not to make it quite so easy to do that stuff, and nick/channel config, all on IRC
 21:23 &lt; GXTi&gt; BearPerson: nope.
 21:23 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: plus the web adapts itself better to text entry
 21:23 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: GXTi is right, ticketing is probably more web-suited, but beyond that, IRC is way too autistic
 21:23 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: if we're going to become a richer, deeper community, we have to have a significant web presence that people use
 21:23 &lt; jonez&gt; GXTi: sure.. for editing and such, but if you want to "monitor" the open tickets, you need something that is *designed* to be refreshed in real time, like an irc bot or an actual curses or gnome application
 21:24 &lt; jonez&gt; lilo: I agree.
 21:24 &lt; BearPerson&gt; So basically everything that does not require IRC is moved to a web component...
 21:24 &lt; GXTi&gt; jonez: perhaps.
 21:24 &lt; BearPerson&gt; user/channel signup, all kinds of permissions and changes
 21:24 &lt; GXTi&gt; so maybe ticket initiation is better sutied for web, while irc notifications are appropriate with concern to the ticket itself.
 21:24 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: IRC traditionalists tend to hold us back as a community service, because they are convinced that IRC is useless and they propagate that meme constantly
 21:24 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: some notifications on IRC make sense
 21:25 &lt; GXTi&gt; email notifications would also be good
 21:25  * lilo thinks IRC is as useful as you can make it
 21:25 &lt; GXTi&gt; for archival purposes
 21:25  * lilo nods at GXTi 
 21:25 &lt; jonez&gt; lilo: why would an "irc traditionalist" state that irc is useless?
 21:25 &lt; GXTi&gt; jonez: because they won't let it grow into anything not useless.
 21:25 &lt; GXTi&gt; it's a hobby, a toy, etc.
 21:25 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: because they come from places like EFNet that grew up as general chat networks, with a whole culture around them that disdained serious use
 21:25 &lt; BearPerson&gt; IRC services would be reduced to a (stripped) NickServ for people to authentificate to, a ChanServ to set channel modes based on auth, and an OperServ to notify opers about ticket stuff
 21:25  * lilo nods at GXTi 
 21:25 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: something like that, yes
 21:26 &lt; GXTi&gt; users would also be notified about tickets they submitted.
 21:26 &lt; jonez&gt; well we musn't forget that there are bits of the "jabber" protocol having to do with "group chat".
 21:26 &lt; BearPerson&gt; jonez, <a href="http://partiallystapled.com/wiki/index.php/TraditionalIRCUsers" class='external' rel="nofollow">http://partiallystapled.com/wiki/index.php/TraditionalIRCUsers</a> is a nice short writeup
</pre>
<a name="Connection_and_authentication"></a><h3>Connection and authentication</h3>
<pre> 21:26 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: but ultimately, get rid of the nicks and replace them with numeric messages and notices from the server
 21:26 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: yes!
 21:26 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: btw, opinion on the logo-ish thingy i made for the wiki, if any?
 21:26 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah, that's a good idea
 21:26 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: here's my thing....I don't care about client protocol.... right now we are using a pure ircd
 21:26 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: so we talk ircd
 21:26 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: it worked&nbsp;:)
 21:27 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: we need to talk everything that we can talk and have people use it to connect to us successfully&nbsp;:)
 21:27 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: ircd may be the main protocol forever, or maybe not
 21:27 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: *that's not our call*&nbsp;:)
 21:27  * BearPerson wonders if password auth at connection level would be an option
 21:27 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: our users should decide
 21:28 &lt; BearPerson&gt; the old PASS command or what it was
 21:28 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: yes, it will
 21:28 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: PASS and I think there are some newer interfaces
 21:28 &lt; jonez&gt; lilo: ok.
 21:28 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: my sense is, use any of them 8)
 21:28 &lt; GXTi&gt; pass is kind of dated.
 21:28 &lt; BearPerson&gt; will be some change to users
 21:28 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: but everybody can do it
 21:28 &lt; GXTi&gt; i'd vouch for unpassworded login, but you can't join any channels/message users until you auth.
 21:28 &lt; BearPerson&gt; as opposed to md5sum login or something
 21:28 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: ideally we should not try to do nonstandard things at connect
 21:28 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson:  we want people to connect their clients here with minimum change
 21:28 &lt; GXTi&gt; ie /nickserv commands still
 21:28 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah, nonstandard things aren't too good
 21:29 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: hmmm.... the problem is, that's traditional IRC
 21:29 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: I want something a bit different
 21:29 &lt; BearPerson&gt; but it might work at least for a transition period
 21:29 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: not when you deny access to non-authed users though
 21:29 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: "to use your nick, you have to connect with a password, otherwise you're a guest"
 21:29 &lt; lilo&gt; let guests be irc-like
 21:29 &lt; lilo&gt; but reserve people their reserved nicks
 21:29 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: PASS simply denies people, that gives them an opportiunity to learn why they're being dined.
 21:29 &lt; GXTi&gt; denied.
 21:29 &lt; GXTi&gt; ah
 21:29 &lt; GXTi&gt; good point.
 21:29 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: you can send people a notice before you disconnect
 21:30 &lt; BearPerson&gt; well, something we should consider:
 21:30 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: the clients should all accept it
 21:30 &lt; BearPerson&gt; a lot of the channels here offer support
 21:30 &lt; BearPerson&gt; and some people just come in once, ask a question, thank, and go
 21:30 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: i do like the idea of allowing peple who don't PASS up(to non-registered nicks) in as guests.
 21:30 &lt; GXTi&gt; didn't think of that.
 21:30 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: yes, you want people to be able to use the network without registering
 21:30 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I don't think they'll like having to register
 21:30 &lt; BearPerson&gt; right
 21:30 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: that's one area where irc gets it right
 21:30 &lt; BearPerson&gt; so why register?
 21:31 &lt; BearPerson&gt; to be able to keep your nick...
 21:31 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: because we need to encourage a sense of community, and encourage networking between the participants
 21:31 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: so we give nice bennies for registering&nbsp;;)
 21:31 &lt; BearPerson&gt;&nbsp;:)
 21:31 &lt; lilo&gt; irc has a problem
 21:31 &lt; lilo&gt; lack of personal responsibility
 21:31 &lt; lilo&gt; you don't see it as much on freenode
 21:32 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: would you want people who try to connect unpassworded with a registered nick in?
 21:32 &lt; lilo&gt; but it's integral to the culture
 21:32 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: change the nick
 21:32 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: right.
 21:32 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah
 21:32 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: I think dalnet does that, so the clients should support it
 21:32 &lt; lilo&gt; here's the thing about personal responsibility
 21:32 &lt; BearPerson&gt; why not just tell them a standard "nick already taken"?
 21:32 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: can do that, but it makes it harder for them to connect
 21:32 &lt; BearPerson&gt; a registered nick is just already in
 21:32 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: we want to let newbies come in easily, even from irc
 21:32 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: minimum obstruction
 21:33 &lt; BearPerson&gt; well, it wouldn't be much different
 21:33 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: why make them change nicks?
 21:33 &lt; BearPerson&gt; if they can't come in as that nick because someone is on
 21:33 &lt; lilo&gt; also
 21:33 &lt; BearPerson&gt; with it
 21:33 &lt; lilo&gt; if they get their nick changed, that says something
 21:33 &lt; BearPerson&gt; or because someone is registered with it
 21:33 &lt; lilo&gt; registered users don't have their nicks changed&nbsp;;)
 21:33 &lt; lilo&gt; another benefit
 21:33 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I don't mean changed that way
 21:33 &lt; lilo&gt; remember, we want to pull people into community
 21:33 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: hmmm?
 21:34 &lt; BearPerson&gt; We're trying to avoid clients joining as registered nicks
 21:34 &lt; BearPerson&gt; without a password
 21:34 &lt; BearPerson&gt; so when they come in as one, just tell them "nick in use"
 21:34 &lt; GXTi&gt; i'm not so sure changing someone's nick to guest-foo just because theyre not registered is a win
 21:34 &lt; BearPerson&gt; which will happen quite frequently on IRC
 21:34 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I'm not saying that
 21:34 &lt; jilles&gt; GXTi, afaik, dalnet does it that way
 21:34 &lt; BearPerson&gt; If someone were to log in as BearPerson right now, what would happen?
 21:34 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: dalnet isn't really what we're trying to model after though, is it?
 21:34 &lt; jilles&gt; indeed
 21:35 &lt; BearPerson&gt; his client gets a message back and it retries with BearPerson_
 21:35 &lt; BearPerson&gt; why not model the same behavior for registered nicks?
 21:35 &lt; BearPerson&gt; a registered nick is just supposedly always taken
 21:36 &lt; BearPerson&gt; ERR_NICKNAMEINUSE
 21:36 &lt; jilles&gt; but BearPerson_ is registered too
 21:36 &lt; GXTi&gt; same behavior
 21:36 &lt; jilles&gt; another nick in use
 21:36 &lt; BearPerson&gt; well, then the same happens as in ordinary IRC when BearPerson_ is also logged on
 21:36 &lt; GXTi&gt; denying with a nick in use message is a good idea, but the double-bounce with the _ nick is problematic.
 21:37 &lt; BearPerson&gt; if the client just appends a _
 21:37 &lt; GXTi&gt; maybe changing to guest-* is a better idea.
 21:37 &lt; BearPerson&gt; not all of them do
 21:37 &lt; jilles&gt; then you get __ stuff
 21:37 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah, if you have a Dave that registers everything up to Dave____________, things get ugly
 21:37 &lt; BearPerson&gt; when someone with such a client signs on
 21:38 &lt; BearPerson&gt; xchat just offers 3 alternate nicks to use
 21:39 &lt; BearPerson&gt; but I don't see where the big difference between a registered nick and an used nick would be
 21:39 &lt; BearPerson&gt; Though the appending-'_' strategy of some clients does lead to ugliness
 21:40  * BearPerson notices he's pretty much out-talked everyone these last minutes - oops, sorry guys
 21:40 &lt; GXTi&gt; it happens&nbsp;;p
 21:41 &lt; jonez&gt; well xchat just uses that as a default, and the user is free to change it if they want.
 21:41 &lt; GXTi&gt; changing a user's nick to Guest-* avoids the appending underscore issue, as well as directly telling them they're a guest on the network.
 21:41 &lt; GXTi&gt; but what do you do if Guest-* tries to change nicks?
 21:41 &lt; BearPerson&gt; change it to Guest-&lt;requestednick&gt;
 21:41 &lt; GXTi&gt; hm, good idea.
 21:42 &lt; BearPerson&gt; maybe they'd get a special connection class too
 21:42 &lt; BearPerson&gt; less tolerance for flooding, join/parting
 21:42 &lt; GXTi&gt; all users not providing a password, or the wrong password, get renamed to Guest-*, at which point they can register.
 21:42 &lt; BearPerson&gt; how about this one.... Max. 2 connections per IP for guests, Max. 5 per IP for registered
 21:42 &lt; BearPerson&gt; GXTi, they would register on the website
 21:42 &lt; GXTi&gt; perhaps however there should be a way to auth up while already connected
 21:43 &lt; GXTi&gt; BearPerson: yes.
 21:43 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah
 21:43 &lt; lilo&gt; the person who should get the priority is the user registered with the nick
 21:43 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: yes.
 21:43 &lt; GXTi&gt; if such a user exists.
 21:43 &lt; BearPerson&gt; Guest-foo should be able to "oh, I mistyped the password there... Okay, let's /unguest mypass"
 21:43 &lt; BearPerson&gt; if that is possible
 21:43 &lt; lilo&gt; maybe they should just identify 
 21:43 &lt; GXTi&gt; but if you don't provide a valid password, whether the target user exists or not, you get Guest-&lt;nick requested&gt;[clone count]
 21:43 &lt; lilo&gt; here's what I'm thinking
 21:44 &lt; lilo&gt; assume there's a generic IDENTIFY command on the server
 21:44 &lt; lilo&gt; the server goes out to the database and processes it
 21:44 &lt; lilo&gt; the user gets changed to one of their registered nicks
 21:44 &lt; lilo&gt; but the IDENTIFY is not just by nick
 21:44 &lt; lilo&gt; it's by *user*
 21:44 &lt; BearPerson&gt; ...database access from every server...
 21:45 &lt; jilles&gt; IDENTIFY by nick is stupid in any case
 21:45 &lt; lilo&gt;  the emphasis on freenodeRegistry is *users* and *groups*, not *nicks* and *channels*
 21:45 &lt; GXTi&gt; right. gamesurge uses a similar system,
 21:45  * lilo nods at jilles
 21:45 &lt; BearPerson&gt; so you'd /IDENTIFY lilo whateverpassword
 21:45 &lt; GXTi&gt; though nicks are open to anyone
 21:45 &lt; lilo&gt; yes
 21:45 &lt; BearPerson&gt; and become one of the aliases of lilo
 21:45 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah, detaching users from nicks might be something good
 21:45 &lt; lilo&gt; one thing to remember is, some traditional people are going to look at any changes we make that seem to be broken *as* IRC, and they'll have to decide what's important to them
 21:45 &lt; GXTi&gt; what happens if you're out of free nicks?
 21:45 &lt; jonez&gt; BearPerson: good point.
 21:45 &lt; GXTi&gt; anothernick-1?
 21:45 &lt; lilo&gt; traditional IRC, or the reasons the network is here
 21:46 &lt; BearPerson&gt; do we need an "Is registered as FooBar" on a whois?
 21:46 &lt; GXTi&gt; hm, mechanics.
 21:46 &lt; jilles&gt; another trick is to use nicks starting with a digit
 21:46 &lt; GXTi&gt; BearPerson: it'd be in a default cloak.
 21:46 &lt; jilles&gt; for the special purposes
 21:46 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: have thought a bit about that, it's a good idea
 21:46 &lt; GXTi&gt; username.user or whatever.
 21:46 &lt; GXTi&gt; well, user/username new&nbsp;:)
 21:46 &lt; lilo&gt; periods create problems
 21:46 &lt; jilles&gt; whois showing "is logged in as" is not that unusual
 21:46 &lt; lilo&gt; clients expect entities with periods in their names to be server names
 21:46 &lt; lilo&gt; because servers do
 21:47 &lt; BearPerson&gt; banning *.user&nbsp;:)
 21:47 &lt; GXTi&gt; not nicks, etc, just the hostname used in /whois and such.
 21:47 &lt; GXTi&gt; what you're already proposing.
 21:47 &lt; jonez&gt; lilo: the minute you add a server command that isn't in the RFC, you are outside the protocol and prolly shouldn't call it "irc" anymore.
 21:48 &lt; jilles&gt; jonez, nope
 21:48 &lt; BearPerson&gt; are we going to hold on to the channel access levels and user level things?
 21:48 &lt; GXTi&gt; then irc wouldn't have been called irc years ago.
 21:48 &lt; BearPerson&gt; right
 21:48 &lt; jilles&gt; hybrid did it with /knock and /accept for example
 21:48 &lt; BearPerson&gt; SJOIN between servers
 21:48 &lt; BearPerson&gt; timestamping for channels
 21:48 &lt; jilles&gt; for _between servers_ the RFC is irrelevant
 21:48 &lt; jonez&gt; does the rfc allow for extensions to the protocol?
 21:48 &lt; jilles&gt; each ircd can happily use its own protocol for that
 21:49 &lt; lilo&gt; access levels are broken
 21:49 &lt; jonez&gt; jilles: agree. I was thinking about lilo's plan to add "/identify", which would be c to s
</pre>
<a name="Capabilities"></a><h3>Capabilities</h3>
<pre> 21:49 &lt; lilo&gt; numeric access levels are arcane
 21:49 &lt; lilo&gt; named capabilities are good
 21:49 &lt; BearPerson&gt; sounds good
 21:49 &lt; GXTi&gt; sure.
 21:49 &lt; BearPerson&gt; would the database be up to it?
 21:49 &lt; GXTi&gt; BearPerson: absolutely.
 21:49 &lt; BearPerson&gt; in terms of lookup speed, size etc.
 21:49 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: /quote identify, which can be aliased; or you can /msg identify
 21:49 &lt; jonez&gt; lilo: ah. ok.
 21:50 &lt; GXTi&gt; if it came down to it, you'd have a table for capabilities on a given channel.
 21:50 &lt; BearPerson&gt; will we patch the ircd for those commands or have a central services server that recognizes them?
 21:50 &lt; BearPerson&gt; we probably need both
 21:50 &lt; GXTi&gt; each field would be a capability with boolean value.
 21:50 &lt; BearPerson&gt; sounds good
 21:50 &lt; GXTi&gt; with th exception of the user id of course.
 21:50 &lt; jilles&gt; or a list of granted capabilities
 21:50 &lt; BearPerson&gt; user by ID?
 21:50 &lt; GXTi&gt; i'm assuming they'd be numbered.
 21:50 &lt; GXTi&gt; faster.
 21:51 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah, why not...
 21:51 &lt; BearPerson&gt; indeed
 21:51 &lt; jilles&gt; problem with such capability lists is that you have to have "standard" lists
 21:51 &lt; GXTi&gt; hm?
 21:51 &lt; BearPerson&gt; well, I don't think we'll have users adding capabilities
 21:51 &lt; jilles&gt; because inevitably you'll end up with the possibility of "crippled" capability lists
 21:51 &lt; BearPerson&gt; just the standard "gets autovoice, can request voice" etc.
 21:52 &lt; BearPerson&gt; explain please?
 21:52 &lt; jilles&gt; i.e. someone says "you're an op" and grants you a capability set that misses some important stuff
 21:52 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: not too difficult to autorepair.
 21:52 &lt; jilles&gt; this is general
 21:52 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm...
 21:52 &lt; GXTi&gt; oh.
 21:52 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I don't think we need the capabilities to be too fine-grained
 21:52 &lt; GXTi&gt; then yes, a general ruleset would be suitable.
 21:52 &lt; jonez&gt; jilles: ah. for that, we could have "roles", which you grant to users.. the "you're an op" role would have capabilities assigned to it.. kind of like a template.
 21:52 &lt; jilles&gt; jonez, yes
 21:53 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah, that doesn't sound bad
 21:53 &lt; GXTi&gt; ie standard op would just be the capability to +o up
 21:53 &lt; GXTi&gt; where as setting more capabilities could be individual.
 21:53 &lt; jilles&gt; that is not the case in currently
 21:53 &lt; jilles&gt; level 10 also grants /cs unban, for example
 21:53 &lt; BearPerson&gt; by default
 21:53 &lt; jilles&gt; and the capability to secretly (de)voice and (de)op other users
 21:54 &lt; BearPerson&gt; would we allow users to "not use" certain priviliges?
 21:54 &lt; BearPerson&gt; like I'm granted autoop
 21:54 &lt; BearPerson&gt; but I just want autovoice
 21:54 &lt; jilles&gt; /mode +v-o yournick yournick
 21:54 &lt; jilles&gt;&nbsp;:)
 21:54 &lt; BearPerson&gt; by default&nbsp;:)
 21:54 &lt; BearPerson&gt; will users just be able to switch the capabilities they're granted on/off? would make sense
 21:55 &lt; BearPerson&gt; but need slightly more overhead
 21:55 &lt; jilles&gt; I'm not sure
 21:55 &lt; GXTi&gt; so some base capabilities could be op, voice(de- included), and banlist manipulation.
 21:55 &lt; jonez&gt; heh.. slightly is right
 21:55 &lt; jonez&gt; depends on how it is done in the database.
 21:55 &lt; GXTi&gt; higher up might be mode setting, topiclock, and userlist management.
 21:55 &lt; jilles&gt; "banlist manipulation"?
 21:55 &lt; jilles&gt; that's akick?
 21:55 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: akick needs to die.
 21:55 &lt; GXTi&gt; just ban mangement from a web interface.
 21:56 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmmm... some IRC troubles should be able to be handled from IRC though, IMO
 21:56 &lt; jilles&gt; and I think any normal op should be able to set things like +imrR temporarily
 21:56 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I don't want to have to switch to a browser just because someone's spamming my channel
 21:56 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: being able to get +o is enough to set modes not locked.
 21:56 &lt; jilles&gt; those can be modelocked but I don't like modelocking them off
 21:56 &lt; GXTi&gt; so the base op layer would include that.
 21:56 &lt; GXTi&gt; although stripping mode ability should be possible.
 21:56 &lt; GXTi&gt; ie if they don't have can_set_modes or whatever, registry reverses any changes they make.
 21:57 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah
 21:57 &lt; GXTi&gt; or even have a field of modes they can('t) set.
 21:57 &lt; BearPerson&gt; this doesn't sound like it would be all that hard to implement&nbsp;:)
 21:57 &lt; GXTi&gt; user_set_modes = "-ntp" so they can't alter those
 21:57 &lt; jilles&gt; but the "default" should be to allow setting everything not modelocked
 21:57 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: right, mode setting would be defaulted with the general set of "op" privs.
 21:57 &lt; BearPerson&gt; well, I'd say just the op template should include "+imrR"
 21:58 &lt; BearPerson&gt; you can remove or add to them whatever way you want
 21:58 &lt; BearPerson&gt; they'd be just the sane defaults
 21:58 &lt; GXTi&gt; now that i think about it, having a specific list of modes per user would be good.
 21:58 &lt; BearPerson&gt; (IMO)
 21:58 &lt; GXTi&gt; almost like a user-specific modelock.
 21:58 &lt; jilles&gt; +k can be allowed too, if you add a command for authorized users to request the key
 21:58 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah
 21:58 &lt; GXTi&gt; though having defaults for them would be a necessity.
 21:58 &lt; jilles&gt; +J needs some kind of override
 21:59 &lt; GXTi&gt; +fJ should be higher-level.
 21:59 &lt; BearPerson&gt; services could just check user_can_change_mode(user,channel,mode)
 21:59 &lt; jilles&gt; I think /invite'ing someone should allow them in regardless of +J
 21:59 &lt; BearPerson&gt; and it'd be a simple database lookup
 21:59 &lt; GXTi&gt; i think being registered should allow yo in regardless of +J
 21:59 &lt; GXTi&gt; but that's just me
</pre>
<a name="Bot_prevention"></a><h3>Bot prevention</h3>
<pre> 21:59 &lt; jilles&gt; there are bots that register
 21:59 &lt; BearPerson&gt; what was +J again?
 21:59 &lt; jilles&gt; join throttling
 21:59 &lt; GXTi&gt; join flood protection
 22:00 &lt; BearPerson&gt; ah
 22:00 &lt; BearPerson&gt; we can make the website logon basically bot-immune
 22:00 &lt; jilles&gt; an alternative is to disallow very strict +J settings
 22:00 &lt; GXTi&gt; i'd suggest +imrR
 22:00 &lt; BearPerson&gt; use some nice stuff only humans can read/understand
 22:00 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: we should probably avoid +J heuristics.
 22:00  * BearPerson votes for ascii-art-numbers&nbsp;:)
</pre>
<a name="Bans"></a><h3>Bans</h3>
<pre> 22:01 &lt; GXTi&gt; BearPerson: using the funky images with strings embedded in them for registry/login is a good idea.
 22:01 &lt; GXTi&gt; registry at least.
 22:01 &lt; GXTi&gt; and maybe a 4-6 hour delay between registration and when you can actually auth up.
 22:01 &lt; BearPerson&gt; would keep bots mostly out
 22:01 &lt; GXTi&gt; that way staff can notice a bot registration issue if one eists.
 22:01 &lt; BearPerson&gt; nah, people might not like that
 22:01 &lt; BearPerson&gt; but yeah, it might be neccessary
 22:02 &lt; GXTi&gt; if non-registered bots are causing problems, +b Guest-* is always possible.
 22:02 &lt; BearPerson&gt; right
 22:02 &lt; GXTi&gt; or using +J if it didn't affect registered users(possibly under control of a umode or registry setting)
 22:02 &lt; BearPerson&gt; or +r would still work
 22:02 &lt; BearPerson&gt; (or whatever only-registered-users was)
 22:03 &lt; jilles&gt; yah it's +r
 22:03 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: thoughts?
 22:03 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm... I wonder... maybe a ban on time-since-register - is this too funky?
 22:03 &lt; GXTi&gt; interesting but implausible
 22:03 &lt; jilles&gt; I think you can't fully prevent bot registrations
 22:03 &lt; BearPerson&gt; ban all people that have only signed up in the last 3 hours
 22:03 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: image scrambling can help though
 22:04 &lt; jilles&gt; BearPerson, simply implementable by denying +e (or similar) to users that have signed up only very recently
 22:04 &lt; BearPerson&gt; by the way... how far are we into "hiding non-neccessary info from non-opers" or whatever?
 22:05 &lt; BearPerson&gt; user hostnames would eventually fall in that category
 22:05 &lt; BearPerson&gt; though hostnames are nice to see where people are coming from...
 22:06 &lt; GXTi&gt; brb.
 22:06 &lt; jilles&gt; the problem is that everyone can (in principle) be a channel operator
 22:06 &lt; jilles&gt; so they must be able to view and change the ban list
 22:06 &lt; jilles&gt; and I consider banning on IP useful
 22:07 &lt; jilles&gt; allowing any user (even banned) to view the ban list is useful as well
 22:08 &lt; BearPerson&gt; useful, yeah
 22:08 &lt; GXTi&gt; back.
 22:08 &lt; BearPerson&gt; would it make sense to be able to deny it to them?
 22:08 &lt; jilles&gt; perhaps you can do it if you have far less unregistered users
 22:08 &lt; jilles&gt; but then "sockpuppets" become a problem
 22:09 &lt; BearPerson&gt;&nbsp;?
 22:09 &lt; jilles&gt; i.e. people who register lots of accounts
 22:09 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah
 22:09 &lt; jilles&gt; when one account is banned, they use the next
 22:09 &lt; lilo&gt; jilles: it can be made harder to register
 22:09 &lt; jilles&gt; banning on IP prevents that
 22:09 &lt; lilo&gt; ah, sorry, bit behind
 22:09 &lt; BearPerson&gt; banning on account shouldn't really be the only, if at all a, way
 22:10 &lt; jilles&gt; banning on account is useful if the banned person isn't very hostile
 22:10 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah
 22:10 &lt; lilo&gt; one thing we know is that unregistered users are harder to provide access to
 22:10 &lt; lilo&gt; because it's hard to separate abusive from non-abusive unregistered users
 22:11 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I'd say one thing we can do is tighten the abuse-checking on unregistered users
 22:11 &lt; GXTi&gt; i do like the idea of suspending +e to users for a period of time after registration.
 22:11 &lt; lilo&gt; there is only so much you can do with unregistered users
 22:11 &lt; BearPerson&gt; they can only join 10 channels per 10 minutes or something
 22:11 &lt; lilo&gt; one thing about IRC....in some ways it's a weird, intrusive idea that you should display IRC users' originating hostname
 22:11 &lt; lilo&gt; I'm not saying that one shouldn't
 22:12 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah, I guess it is IRC-typical
 22:12 &lt; lilo&gt; it's just kind of a weird idea, if you think about it
 22:12 &lt; BearPerson&gt; indeed
 22:12 &lt; BearPerson&gt; but I guess people have gotten used to it a lot
 22:12 &lt; GXTi&gt; maybe staff can handle such abusive users with our magical new ticketing system.
 22:12 &lt; lilo&gt; well, there are no panaceas
 22:12 &lt; jilles&gt; perhaps it is to put at least some form of seriousness in it
 22:12 &lt; lilo&gt; it's hard to allow access to users with no reputation
 22:12 &lt; GXTi&gt; if a user is account hopping, submit a trouble ticket and someone from staff can deal with it, either at a channel or network level.
 22:12 &lt; lilo&gt; we want to do it, we work to do it
 22:12 &lt; BearPerson&gt; well, we do have cloaks if people don't want their hostname displayed
 22:13  * lilo nods
 22:13 &lt; jilles&gt; BearPerson, but traditional IRC does not have those, except for opers
 22:13 &lt; jilles&gt; and perhaps a select few other people close to admins
 22:13 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: many networks have a +x usermode that either uses a hashed hostname or a cloak assigned by services.
 22:13 &lt; BearPerson&gt; well, here, they're freely available... so what would be the point?
 22:14 &lt; GXTi&gt; not exactly traditional persay, but popular.
 22:14 &lt; jonez&gt; BearPerson: well, back in the nsfnet days, there wasn't such a thing as an "abusive user".. the irc protocol was designed a long time ago.
 22:14 &lt; jonez&gt; (re: displaying hostname)
 22:14 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah
 22:14 &lt; BearPerson&gt; well, I suppose... let's see
 22:14 &lt; jilles&gt; GXTi, the same could be said about services, in a sense
 22:14 &lt; BearPerson&gt; unregged display their hostname
 22:14 &lt; BearPerson&gt; have to
 22:14 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: indeed.
 22:15 &lt; GXTi&gt; BearPerson: yes
 22:15 &lt; BearPerson&gt; registered by default display user/&lt;name&gt;
 22:15 &lt; BearPerson&gt; and can opt out
 22:15 &lt; GXTi&gt; or get a different cloak
 22:15 &lt; GXTi&gt; hm...
 22:15 &lt; BearPerson&gt; setting their preferences to give them the NULL-cloak, or their original hostname
 22:15 &lt; BearPerson&gt; well, it would just come down to defaults
 22:15 &lt; GXTi&gt; if users can switch freely between cloaks, it'd be necessary to match bans against all of a user's cloaks as well as their real hostname.
 22:15 &lt; BearPerson&gt; do you want the user to have a cloak by default or not?
 22:16 &lt; GXTi&gt; but since registry is server-side, that wouldn't be too load intensive
 22:16 &lt; GXTi&gt; just query all a user's available cloaks on join
 22:16 &lt; jilles&gt; GXTi, against "all cloaks" seems nasty
 22:16 &lt; BearPerson&gt; ouch... that'll be a server patch, or some extra workload for services
 22:16 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: nastier than switching cloaks to evade bans?
 22:16 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I can picture that
 22:16 &lt; jilles&gt; GXTi, nasty from implementation perspective
 22:16 &lt; BearPerson&gt; "... has joined #..."
 22:16 &lt; jonez&gt; the ban should be based on hostmask without the cloak applied.
 22:17 &lt; BearPerson&gt; "services has kicked ... (one of your cloaks are banned)
 22:17 &lt; jonez&gt; opers should be able to determine "actual" hostmask for this purpose.
 22:17 &lt; jilles&gt; BearPerson, no!!!
 22:17 &lt; BearPerson&gt; which kindof destroys the purpose of a ban
 22:17 &lt; GXTi&gt; jonez: impossible, because clients can't see their real hostname.
 22:17 &lt; jilles&gt; but we could change things so bans need only be known on the user's server and not on other servers
 22:17 &lt; BearPerson&gt; jilles, services can only react
 22:17 &lt; jilles&gt; BearPerson, that cannot be done because it leads to disaster if someone has autorejoin on
 22:17 &lt; jonez&gt; GXTi: well, the server has the information, it's just been told not to give it to anybody.
 22:18 &lt; jilles&gt; unless you add a new temporary ban
 22:18 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: perhaps it can set another ban on the cloak they tried to use.
 22:18 &lt; BearPerson&gt; we could have a /hostban command...
 22:18 &lt; GXTi&gt; yes.
 22:18 &lt; GXTi&gt; BearPerson: still breaks the encapsulation of the cloak.
 22:18 &lt; BearPerson&gt; tells the server to place a ban on the real hostname
 22:18 &lt; jilles&gt; BearPerson, that'd need to be 2 commands perhaps
 22:18 &lt; GXTi&gt; unless you present a false ban to users.
 22:18 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah... those bans should not be visible
 22:18 &lt; jilles&gt; yuck
 22:18 &lt; GXTi&gt; double yuck.
 22:18 &lt; jilles&gt; ban list should be publicly viewable
 22:18 &lt; BearPerson&gt; or visible as "hostname ban on user/moo"
 22:18 &lt; BearPerson&gt; let's face it
 22:18 &lt; jilles&gt; what if someone unrelated uses the same ip?
 22:18 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: it'd be publicly visible, only users would see a user/ ban instead of a hostname ban.
 22:18 &lt; BearPerson&gt; we need to ban on hostmask
 22:19 &lt; lilo&gt; it kind of makes sense to use the cloak as a surrogate for the real hostname
 22:19 &lt; BearPerson&gt; well, let's see what we have
 22:19 &lt; BearPerson&gt; it is proposed that people can switch cloaks at will
 22:19 &lt; GXTi&gt; from a functional standpoint, it's a great idea.
 22:19 &lt; GXTi&gt; from a coding standpoint, it sucks.
 22:19 &lt; BearPerson&gt; this would make cloaks for banning useless
 22:19 &lt; lilo&gt; in some ways you could give each session a session id, and ban by session id
 22:19 &lt; lilo&gt; and have it actually ban the underlying host
 22:19 &lt; lilo&gt; there are problems
 22:20 &lt; GXTi&gt; ban by user id?
 22:20 &lt; GXTi&gt; internally at least
 22:20 &lt; BearPerson&gt; so the server would need to ban the host instead
 22:20 &lt; lilo&gt; main problem is that it becomes difficult or impossible to wildcard b an
 22:20 &lt; GXTi&gt; then show the user/ cloak to banlist viewers
 22:20 &lt; BearPerson&gt; but the host can't be shown to anyone as such
 22:20 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: perhaps passively interpret the wildcard
 22:20 &lt; BearPerson&gt; lilo, yeah, that would be the main problem I see too
 22:20 &lt; lilo&gt; another problem is that you could have 10 bans for the same hostname
 22:21 &lt; lilo&gt; the alternative is to use the standard hashing
 22:21 &lt; GXTi&gt; we don't need another command for bans.
 22:21 &lt; lilo&gt; so that you don't know what host it is, but you know that foo1 and foo2 are on the same host
 22:21 &lt; jonez&gt; lilo: maybe.. but hopefully we'd have a way to tell that there are already 9 bans on the same hostname before adding a 10th, and be able to consolidate.
 22:21 &lt; lilo&gt; you don't use a new command for banning
 22:21 &lt; lilo&gt; we are trying to support RFC1459-compatible clients
 22:21 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm...
 22:21 &lt; lilo&gt; jonez: but you do have to maintain the visible list in the case of session bans
 22:21 &lt; BearPerson&gt; so we'd need the server to do something smart with a ban placed on a cloak
 22:21  * lilo nods at BearPerson 
 22:22 &lt; BearPerson&gt; theoretically, the server would have to look up - wait
 22:22 &lt; BearPerson&gt; can't we add requirements to cloaks?
 22:22 &lt; BearPerson&gt; like, they always have to end in /&lt;account&gt;&nbsp;?
 22:22 &lt; lilo&gt; well, first, we should ban registered users by username
 22:22 &lt; GXTi&gt; they will.
 22:23 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: interally by id
 22:23 &lt; lilo&gt; maybe we ban using nick but ultimately by real user
 22:23 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: yeah
 22:23 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: because even the user name can change
 22:23 &lt; BearPerson&gt; to users, there will just be a ban on user/&lt;account&gt; or something
 22:23 &lt; lilo&gt; so the cloak shouldn't be involved
 22:23 &lt; lilo&gt; second, for unregistered users, any specifics of cloaking is a moving target
 22:23 &lt; GXTi&gt; i'd suggest that when a ban is set, do a realtime match against any registered users in that channel, then convert it to a user id and set *!*@*/&lt;username&gt; or user/&lt;username&gt;
 22:24 &lt; jonez&gt; I think the issue is figuring out a way to add a ban on someone that has a cloak.
 22:24 &lt; lilo&gt; the underlying ircd will slowly evolve, and at some point probably start evolving more quickly
 22:24 &lt; BearPerson&gt; unregistered users can't cloak I say
 22:24 &lt; GXTi&gt; if no registered users match, set a plain ban
 22:24 &lt; BearPerson&gt; jonez, yeah...
 22:24 &lt; BearPerson&gt; this sounds like some rather heavy ircd patching too
 22:24 &lt; jonez&gt; yep
 22:24 &lt; GXTi&gt; if the bannee is cloaked, then it will definitively only match that user
 22:24 &lt; lilo&gt; well, for now little will change
 22:24 &lt; lilo&gt; we need to remember that
 22:25 &lt; jonez&gt; and all this checking of every user in a channel.. ick.
 22:25 &lt; GXTi&gt; if they're not cloaked, it'd be converted.
 22:25  * BearPerson sees his C knowledge come into play someday too&nbsp;:)
 22:25 &lt; lilo&gt; we don't want freenodeRegistry to be coded in such a way that absolutely requires major changes at the server end
 22:25 &lt; lilo&gt; that's not realistic
 22:25 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah...
 22:25 &lt; BearPerson&gt; so what can we do for now?
 22:25 &lt; lilo&gt; also, there are facilities
 22:25 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: as long as a real hostname and a cloak hostname are kept simultaneously in the server this won't be a problem.
 22:25 &lt; lilo&gt; ircd is a facility
 22:25 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm... hey...
 22:25 &lt; lilo&gt; maybe some later ircd or replacement for ircd will simply be a different facility with different config options
 22:25 &lt; BearPerson&gt; registry isn't deaf
 22:25 &lt; GXTi&gt; because */account will match any cloak by that user.
 22:26 &lt; BearPerson&gt; registry will hear about bans
 22:26 &lt; BearPerson&gt; registry/services/whatever
 22:26 &lt; GXTi&gt; BearPerson: ban conversion from that standpoint could suck.
 22:26 &lt; lilo&gt; for now, we try to make sure that registry provides configuration options for freenode-hyperion which make sense in terms of freenode-hyperion
 22:26 &lt; BearPerson&gt; well, we only need to take action on a cloak change, right?
 22:26 &lt; lilo&gt; which is basically the same as dancer-ircd
 22:27 -!- alindeman [adml@alindeman-gallery.staff.freenode] has joined #freenode-registry
 22:27 &lt; GXTi&gt; the easiest way to solve this is to deny registered users to go without a cloak.
 22:27 &lt; alindeman&gt; Uh oh, scary&nbsp;;)
 22:27 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm... interesting idea
 22:27 &lt; GXTi&gt; alindeman: you're missing out&nbsp;:P
 22:27 &lt; BearPerson&gt; no, I'd propose something different
 22:27 &lt; GXTi&gt; most of the ideas i have though involve major server changes
 22:28 &lt; BearPerson&gt; when someone requests a cloak change at registry, services goes and changes all bans to the new cloak
 22:28 &lt; GXTi&gt; ugly
 22:28 &lt; BearPerson&gt; if they cloak to their real hostname, all bans are converted to that hostname
 22:28 &lt; BearPerson&gt; actually, we just have 2 states
 22:28  * alindeman wonders why we are discussing these types of issues now
 22:28 &lt; BearPerson&gt; a) ban on account name (in absence of a hostname)
 22:29 &lt; GXTi&gt; actually...
 22:29 &lt; BearPerson&gt; b) ban on hostname
 22:29 &lt; BearPerson&gt; b) is more efficient than a) but can't always be used
 22:29 &lt; GXTi&gt; the ideal way to handle it is that registry picks up on a user decloaking, and if they attempt to join the channel again, they get kickbanned. case closed.
 22:29 &lt; GXTi&gt; at most they can rejoin once.
 22:29 &lt; lilo&gt; yeah, and that's not hard
 22:29 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm...
 22:29 &lt; lilo&gt; but then the response is to reconnect
 22:29 &lt; GXTi&gt; if they're decloaked and get banned, they're shut out permenantly because cloaking shouldn't modify their real hostname.
 22:29 &lt; GXTi&gt; servers still know it and still match the ban
 22:30 &lt; BearPerson&gt; right
 22:30 &lt; lilo&gt; yeah, if you go by real hostname, that's fine
 22:30 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hostname is more effective, as I said
 22:30 &lt; jilles&gt; that's not how it currently works, cloaked users cannot be banned on their hostname
 22:30 &lt; jonez&gt; s/hostname/hostmask/
 22:30 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: that needs to be fixed then
 22:30 &lt; BearPerson&gt; basically, we'll have to go by cloak/account as long as they're cloaked
 22:30 &lt; GXTi&gt; which is a potentially large change.
 22:30 &lt; jilles&gt; and I think that has actually been used
 22:30 &lt; GXTi&gt; although setting of cloaks can be totally seperate from normal traffic.
 22:30 &lt; lilo&gt; I would tend to agree that cloaked users should have an underlying ban on IP
 22:30 &lt; BearPerson&gt; because there's no way without a server patch that we can ban by host without revealing it
 22:31 &lt; lilo&gt; I would say IP
 22:31 &lt; lilo&gt; because there's no reason to ban on hostname if you can't wildcard
 22:31 &lt; lilo&gt; I could be missing something
 22:31 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm
 22:31 &lt; jilles&gt; *.tr users getting a cloak to avoid a ban, with staff agreement
 22:31 &lt; lilo&gt; again, caveat time folks
 22:31 &lt; jilles&gt; afaik
 22:31 &lt; lilo&gt; it may be that jilles will find something useful and implementable here
 22:31 &lt; lilo&gt; if so, all to the good
 22:31 &lt; lilo&gt; but registry should be able to handle any style of banning
 22:31 &lt; BearPerson&gt; if you ban an IP, I can just do "host &lt;IP&gt;" and get a hostname
 22:32 &lt; lilo&gt; we don't have to push him to make changes he doesn't feel are currently supportable
 22:32 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: maybe users could get a special umode to disable ban matching on real hostname when cloaked.
 22:32 &lt; lilo&gt; this is good discussion though
 22:32 &lt; jilles&gt; who logs this
 22:32 &lt; GXTi&gt; i'm logging.
 22:32 &lt; lilo&gt; I'm logging it
 22:32  * BearPerson does
 22:32 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hehe
 22:32 &lt; GXTi&gt; alindeman should look over it too.
 22:32 &lt; BearPerson&gt; who's got the best uptime?&nbsp;:)
 22:32 &lt; GXTi&gt; i can put it up on PS.
 22:33 &lt; lilo&gt; I don't try for 100% uptime
 22:33 &lt; alindeman&gt; I'm not confident with python, but I'll help where I can
 22:33 &lt; lilo&gt; bear in mind that some of this discussion is you guys coming up to speed on existing ideas
 22:33 &lt; lilo&gt; and some of it is original
 22:33 &lt; alindeman&gt; Another language should not be hard
 22:33 &lt; BearPerson&gt; same here&nbsp;:)
 22:33 &lt; lilo&gt; it's all good because it's stuff that needs to be considered at some point
 22:33 &lt; lilo&gt; sooner or later, not sure
 22:33 &lt; jilles&gt; well what would be possible is letting bans placed on real hostnames/IPs match cloaked users too, but not provide chanops with enough info to set those
 22:33 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: cloaks should never be revealed to anyone but staff.
 22:34 &lt; BearPerson&gt; jilles, not if we want to keep a transparent banlist
 22:34 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: real hostnames?
 22:34 &lt; jilles&gt; this thing does not reveal cloaks
 22:34 &lt; lilo&gt; it's interesting
 22:34 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: real hostnames, yes.
 22:34 &lt; jilles&gt; except if a user is banned
 22:34 &lt; lilo&gt; we want to ban cloaks and have them match IP's
 22:34 &lt; GXTi&gt; only the cloak should be visible.
 22:34 &lt; lilo&gt; do we really want to ban IP's and have them match cloaks?
 22:34 &lt; BearPerson&gt; lilo, server patch
 22:34 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: yeah
 22:34 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: I'm just talking about it conceptually
 22:34 &lt; BearPerson&gt; banned IPs always match cloaks, no?
 22:34 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: except in special cases
 22:34 &lt; GXTi&gt; ie the *.tr issue
 22:34 &lt; lilo&gt; we can capture subsequent cloaks for real IP's
 22:34 &lt; BearPerson&gt; because the server always knows the real IP
 22:34 &lt; lilo&gt; so it *is* doable
 22:35 &lt; lilo&gt; not sure that's what you want though
 22:35 &lt; GXTi&gt; again i suggested a umode to disable real hostname matchig on cloaked users for special cases
 22:35 &lt; lilo&gt; some situations it's good, some not
 22:35 &lt; jilles&gt; hmm, another idea
 22:35 &lt; jilles&gt; if a cloaked user tries to join and is banned, his IP is added to a secret "cache"
 22:35 &lt; jilles&gt; IPs in the "cache" can never join
 22:35  * lilo nods
 22:36 &lt; lilo&gt; or at least
 22:36 &lt; jilles&gt; entries expire in 24 hours or so
 22:36 &lt; GXTi&gt; expiring, of course.
 22:36 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm...
 22:36 &lt; lilo&gt; IP's in the cache are linked to their cloak
 22:36 &lt; GXTi&gt; +e would apply to that cloak.
 22:36 &lt; BearPerson&gt; let's look over this for a bit...
 22:36 &lt; lilo&gt; expiring bans are a good thing btw
 22:36 &lt; jilles&gt; and chanops have a command to delete entries from the cache matching a particular user
 22:36 &lt; BearPerson&gt; what are we trying to prevent?
 22:36 &lt; lilo&gt; just as a side issue
 22:36 &lt; jilles&gt; or all of them
 22:36 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: just use +e
 22:36 &lt; GXTi&gt; easier.
 22:37 &lt; BearPerson&gt; before we run in the wild here, I'd have us look back on what we're preventing
 22:37 &lt; jilles&gt; point
 22:37 &lt; BearPerson&gt; users avoiding bans
 22:37 &lt; jilles&gt; yes
 22:37 &lt; BearPerson&gt; by getting their cloak banned
 22:37 &lt; BearPerson&gt; and then somehow getting something that doesn't match that ban
 22:37 &lt; BearPerson&gt; another account, another cloak?
 22:37 &lt; BearPerson&gt; the NULL-cloak?
 22:37 &lt; GXTi&gt; account issues would have to be resolved by trouble tickets.
 22:38 &lt; GXTi&gt; null cloaks would be resolved by a ban ip cache
 22:38 &lt; BearPerson&gt; right
 22:38 &lt; jilles&gt; another account, or no account at all
 22:38 &lt; BearPerson&gt; jilles, as soon as they come in as guests they have their hostmask
 22:38 &lt; BearPerson&gt; no account has no cloak
 22:38 &lt; jilles&gt; obviously the IP is also added to the cache if the ban is initially set
 22:38 &lt; BearPerson&gt; and iirc a hostmask ban also affects cloaked users
 22:39 &lt; jilles&gt; seems tempting to remove any "is this user banned" checks on servers other than the server that user is connected to
 22:39 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I still like my idea of services converting cloak-bans to host-bans on a cloak drop
 22:39 &lt; alindeman&gt; Can someone summarize this in a wiki page when the conversation dies down?
 22:39 &lt; jilles&gt; that way we don't have to burst the cache
 22:39 &lt; BearPerson&gt; not me, I'll be sleeping
 22:39 &lt; alindeman&gt; We should probably make a habit of wikizing the result of discussions
 22:39 &lt; jilles&gt; it'll desync a bit, but who cares
 22:39 &lt; BearPerson&gt; good point
 22:39 &lt; GXTi&gt; BearPerson: causes potentially nasty ban setting and unsetting.
 22:39 &lt; alindeman&gt; Carry on&nbsp;:)
 22:40 &lt; GXTi&gt; alindeman: sure.
 22:40 &lt; alindeman&gt; Great, thanks
 22:40 &lt; GXTi&gt; or at least logs
 22:40 &lt; BearPerson&gt; but from what I see, a cloak drop is the only way they can evade a cloak drop
 22:40 &lt; alindeman&gt; Yah, with highlights, maybe
 22:40 &lt; BearPerson&gt; erm, evade a cloak ban
 22:40 &lt; BearPerson&gt; we're trying to work without server patching
 22:41 &lt; GXTi&gt; well considering hyperion is still under development, now is the time to make these changes.
 22:41 &lt; BearPerson&gt; but we do have services at our disposal to do whatever we want
 22:41 &lt; BearPerson&gt; could we deny cloak drops as long as bans on it are in effect?
 22:42 &lt; GXTi&gt; that would involve some heavy checking
 22:42 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah
 22:42 &lt; jilles&gt; services has all ban lists, so it would be possible
 22:42 &lt; BearPerson&gt; but I basically see the cloak drop as where we can cut it off somehow
 22:42 &lt; jilles&gt; very inefficient tho
 22:42 &lt; GXTi&gt; i find the cache idea better really.
 22:42 &lt; jilles&gt; bans can use pattern matching
 22:43 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah...
 22:43 &lt; BearPerson&gt; after all, when they enter a channel without a cloak, their hostmask and IP is revealed anyway
 22:43 &lt; BearPerson&gt; so we can slam down with an IP kickban
 22:43 &lt; GXTi&gt; some server-side ban filtering would be nice.
 22:43 &lt; jilles&gt; and you sometimes see stuff like *!*someuser@*.user
 22:44 &lt; jilles&gt; or *!*someuser@*.active.supporter.pdpc
 22:44 &lt; GXTi&gt; so if you /ban *!*@group/user, it's converted to */user
 22:44 &lt; BearPerson&gt; jilles, more commonly *!*@someuser.user I'd guess
 22:44 &lt; jilles&gt; note: stuff attached to bans sucks
 22:44 &lt; BearPerson&gt; it does
 22:44 &lt; jilles&gt; creates very ugly code
 22:44 &lt; BearPerson&gt; or very ugly counter-measures
 22:44 &lt; alindeman&gt; BearPerson: Actually, more commonly toward jilles's way
 22:44 &lt; BearPerson&gt;&nbsp;:)
 22:45 &lt; alindeman&gt; /ban in most clients defaults to *ident@*.domain
 22:45 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmmm
 22:45 &lt; jilles&gt; which is a good default for normal hostnames
 22:45 &lt; GXTi&gt; alindeman: but with foo/bar formatting, it could get interesting.
 22:45 &lt; alindeman&gt; GXTi: True
 22:45 &lt; GXTi&gt; i'd assume it just bans the entire cloak.
 22:46 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm... can we make services carry a seperate list of bans on cloaks?
 22:46 &lt; BearPerson&gt; then when an uncloaked user joins a channel, it checks if one of the cloaks banned is owned by that user
 22:47 &lt; BearPerson&gt; (banned on that channel)
 22:47 &lt; BearPerson&gt; actually, the channel people could do it themselves
 22:47 &lt; GXTi&gt; the user's hostmask should be stored by services when the cloak ban is set, as well as in the cache. that way if the rejoin after the cache expires, services can still catch it and autokick them with a hostmask ban.
 22:47 &lt; jilles&gt; users trying to evade bans by uncloaking will probably not use their account
 22:47 &lt; BearPerson&gt; 1. they ban *!*@*/&lt;account&gt;
 22:48 &lt; BearPerson&gt; 2. evader comes in with their regular host
 22:48 &lt; BearPerson&gt; 3. they ban his host
 22:48 &lt; BearPerson&gt; his host is thus banned, no way he can come in
 22:48 &lt; BearPerson&gt; just needs 2 bans instead of one
 22:48 &lt; jilles&gt; which is a bad thing
 22:48 &lt; GXTi&gt; and the cloak ban can be removed
 22:48 &lt; GXTi&gt; since the host ban matches both.
 22:48 &lt; BearPerson&gt; actually, the first becomes useless as soon as the second one is there
 22:48 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah
 22:49 &lt; jilles&gt; but I know many ops on freenode won't care about that
 22:49 &lt; jilles&gt; they just keep adding bans and rarely remove any
 22:49 &lt; lilo&gt; alindeman: yeah, this way at least it's pretty much the same code
 22:49 &lt; BearPerson&gt; GXTi, the question is just, will we have the channel people find out it's the evader rejoining
 22:49 &lt; lilo&gt; jilles: there needs to be a default ban timeout at some point
 22:49 &lt; BearPerson&gt; or do we want a noisy services kicking them?
 22:50 &lt; GXTi&gt; that's why services would stash the hostname away along with the cloak ban.
 22:50 &lt; GXTi&gt; if the cache doesn't catch them, services will.
 22:50 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I don't even think we need a cache
 22:50 &lt; jilles&gt; kickban noise sucks
 22:50 &lt; GXTi&gt; i do. it'd prevent noisy registry actions.
 22:50 &lt; BearPerson&gt; we just need a quick list where we can check if their cloak is banned
 22:50 &lt; BearPerson&gt; rather, if a banned cloak belongs to them
 22:51 &lt; BearPerson&gt; ah, I see
 22:51 &lt; BearPerson&gt; so the cache avoids the "does cloak belong to X" lookups
 22:51  * lilo nods at jilles 
 22:51 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah, that is good
 22:51 &lt; GXTi&gt; yes, and it automatically keeps users out instead of having to set bans and kick
 22:52 &lt; BearPerson&gt; we can't keep them out
 22:52 &lt; BearPerson&gt; the server still only has a ban on the cloak
 22:52 &lt; BearPerson&gt; can't have more
 22:52 &lt; GXTi&gt; if there's an issue, there's always +e
 22:52 &lt; GXTi&gt; and when the cloak ban is removed, so is the services attachment to it as well as the cache entry.
 22:53 &lt; BearPerson&gt; services is basically the only one knowing the connection between cloak and host/IP
 22:53 &lt; GXTi&gt; so we really do need an ID attached to bans.
 22:53 &lt; GXTi&gt; eww&nbsp;:P
 22:53 &lt; GXTi&gt; well, servers know too.
 22:53 &lt; BearPerson&gt; servers only know a cloaked user's IP
 22:53 &lt; jilles&gt; could add a username to the cache entry
 22:53 &lt; BearPerson&gt; but not a user's previous cloak
 22:53 &lt; jilles&gt; and not burst the cache at all
 22:53 &lt; BearPerson&gt; people could change nicks
 22:53 &lt; jilles&gt; then the cache entries are not attached to bans
 22:53 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: it'd be better to store their id in the ban, and the cache entry, and when there's a match delete it
 22:54 &lt; GXTi&gt; well, yes itd only be handled locally
 22:54 &lt; GXTi&gt; i think it should be set on all servers though. not bursted, we shouldn't worry about desyncs, but relayed nonetheless
 22:54 &lt; GXTi&gt; in case they hop servers
 22:55 &lt; jilles&gt; that was what I was thinking
 22:55 &lt; jilles&gt; do the processing on bans from local or remote users
 22:55 &lt; jilles&gt; but not on bans from servers
 22:55 &lt; GXTi&gt; if one slips through the cracks, registry can take care of it
 22:55 &lt; GXTi&gt; noise is sometimes unavoidable.
 22:55  * BearPerson wonders if we are talking server patching again
 22:55 &lt; GXTi&gt; BearPerson: server patching is inevitable. the scope of it can be reduced though.
 22:56 &lt; BearPerson&gt; but actually, I'd say impact without _any_ fixes is not too big too
 22:56 &lt; jilles&gt; we also don't want to propagate too much data after netsplits
 22:56 &lt; BearPerson&gt; the people get one chance to evade the ban
 22:56 &lt; GXTi&gt; yes
 22:56 &lt; GXTi&gt; not bursting caches saves bandwidth, and isn't necessary anyway.
 22:56 &lt; BearPerson&gt; so it doesn't quite need the most urgent of fixes
 22:59 &lt; lilo&gt; the less bursting, the better
 23:00 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: thoughts?
 23:01 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: ultimately we need caching and independent sources of data
 23:01 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: that's what I think just off-the-top-of-my-head
 23:03 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: ultimately (and I stress, *ultimately*) the interactive network should be routing chat messages, not state
 23:04 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: and more state should be static
 23:04 &lt; lilo&gt; again, I want to stress, what we have been discussing is not really necessary for freenodeRegistry
 23:05 &lt; lilo&gt; other than we want registry to be talking to a chat system that will ultimately make as much sense as possible
 23:05 &lt; lilo&gt; dancer-ircd and freenode-hyperion are just facilities
 23:05 &lt; lilo&gt; important ones, but facilities
 23:07 &lt; lilo&gt; facilities can be evolved and replaced and augmented&lt;/nowiki&gt;

<a name="Table_Structure"></a><h3>Table Structure</h3>
<pre> 21:25 &lt; nick125&gt; hmm, heres my idea for the table structure: users, channels, and a system table
 21:26 &lt; nick125&gt; the system table would keep information, such as global account types, etc
 21:27 &lt; nick125&gt; I think stuff like licensing information should be put inside of the channels
 21:28 &lt; jilles&gt; what's the licensing table stuff for?&nbsp;:p
 21:28 &lt; nick125&gt; I actually think the licensing would be a more statistical thing
 21:29 &lt; nick125&gt; possibly to check and make sure channels are actually open-source related
 21:30 &lt; nick125&gt; see what channels are open-source related, see which ones are chat channels, etc
 21:30 &lt; nick125&gt; I think there should be a column for channel_type
 21:31 &lt; jilles&gt; I don't think lilo likes the idea of "chat channels"&nbsp;;p
 21:32 &lt; nick125&gt; well, they exist, and, you really have to expect to see that in a IRC network
 21:32  * nick125 wonders what half of the network
 21:32 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: primary/secondary perhaps
 21:33 &lt; GXTi&gt; although that's easily implied from the number of #
 21:33 &lt; jilles&gt; there's something to say for a separate primary/secondary field
 21:33 &lt; nick125&gt; well, there are also channels that dont have anything todo with open-source and are mostly general chitchat channels
 21:53 &lt; lilo&gt; jilles: I don't mind chat channels at all
 21:53 &lt; lilo&gt; jilles: it's just that I want to see people do things that will help them say, and become more, cohesive as a productive community
 21:53 &lt; lilo&gt; s/say,/stay,/
 21:53 &lt; nick125&gt; though, I think adding a 'war3z' catagory is just begging for trouble IMO
 21:54 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hehe
 21:54 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: probably 8)
 21:54  * lilo hopes we don't have any categories like that&nbsp;;)
 21:54 &lt; nick125&gt; lilo: I think its more like 'definatly'
 21:54 &lt; BearPerson&gt; a category "illegal stuff that the fbi would shut the server down for"
 21:54 &lt; nick125&gt; fbi? wouldnt that be illegal pornography stuff?
 21:55 &lt; jilles&gt; BearPerson, hmm, that depends on the degree of staff involvement
 21:55 &lt; BearPerson&gt;&nbsp;:)
 21:55 &lt; lilo&gt; regardless, I've done what I can to discourage that stuff
 21:55 &lt; lilo&gt; and freenode-registry should help us do a better job of it
 21:55 &lt; nick125&gt; illegal music is done by the riaa, illegal movies is done by the mpaa, illegal software would be done by the bsa, etc
 21:56 &lt; nick125&gt; lilo: can you clarify that a little bit on how it will help? 
 21:56 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: for one thing, it is my opinion that warez is inextricably linked with traditional IRC
 21:56 &lt; nick125&gt; Correct.
 21:56 &lt; nick125&gt; IRC and illegal activity usually go hand in hand
</pre>
<a name="Traditional_Users"></a><h3>Traditional Users</h3>
<pre> 21:56 &lt; lilo&gt; freenode-registry will make a lot of traditional IRC people very uncomfortable I think
 21:56 &lt; lilo&gt; it's certainly intended to 8)
 21:57 &lt; lilo&gt; our most supportable user base consists of people who have wandered in here with no prior IRC experience
 21:57 &lt; lilo&gt; they accept us as an institution, they let us do what we do
 21:57 &lt; lilo&gt; they let us try to run a service
 21:57 &lt; lilo&gt; <a href="http://partiallystapled.com/wiki/index.php/TraditionalIRCUsers" class='external' rel="nofollow">http://partiallystapled.com/wiki/index.php/TraditionalIRCUsers</a>
 21:57 &lt; lilo&gt; those are the other side
 21:58  * nick125 raises his hand&nbsp;:P freenode is my first and only IRC network i use regulary. I do go on other irc networks for some things, but, not often
 21:58 &lt; lilo&gt; they've always got reasons why nobody should take freenode seriously
 21:58 &lt; lilo&gt; they've always got reasons why there should not be any sort of institution behind freenode
 21:58 &lt; lilo&gt; they've always got reasons why we should not have any paid staff or any budget
 21:58 &lt; nick125&gt; well, freenode has a stand in the open source community
 21:58  * lilo nods
 21:58 &lt; BearPerson&gt; well, freenode isn't really an Internet Relayed Chaos server
 21:58 &lt; nick125&gt; it cost money to run a IRC network of this size
 21:58 &lt; lilo&gt; they always have reasons why warez is okay, why proprietary software is of equal standing
 21:59 &lt; BearPerson&gt; it is a place for projects to communicate
 21:59 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: we get donated bandwidth and server space
 21:59 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: they're right enough about that
 21:59 &lt; nick125&gt; lilo: correct about that
 21:59 &lt; BearPerson&gt; "If you don't like us, go somewhere else. There are enough people that do like freenode"
 21:59 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: but even having cheap paid management is anathema to traditional IRC people
 21:59  * lilo nods
 21:59 &lt; jilles&gt; in that way freenode is the same as a traditional IRC network
 21:59  * lilo nods at jilles
 21:59 &lt; jilles&gt; (bandwidth, servers)
 21:59 &lt; nick125&gt; correct
 21:59 &lt; lilo&gt; jilles: sure....otherwise we just couldn't provide the service
 22:00 &lt; lilo&gt; PDPC's budget is about $25,200 for a year, including one $16K salary
 22:00 &lt; lilo&gt; I get paid that salary and I support 2 dependents on it
 22:00 &lt; lilo&gt; and that is anathema to traditional people 8)
 22:00 &lt; lilo&gt; weird 8)
 22:00 &lt; lilo&gt; IRC is supposed to be a professional-quality hobby which is providing a service which supports no useful activity
 22:00 &lt; nick125&gt; lilo: well, some people thing $16K is alot for running a IRC network
 22:01 &lt; jilles&gt; traditionally, the work you do would probably be divided among multiple people
 22:01 &lt; lilo&gt; useful activities are supposed to be supported by random chance
 22:01 &lt; nick125&gt; 'supposed' is the word
 22:01 &lt; jilles&gt; who all have jobs
 22:01 &lt; lilo&gt; jilles: the problem is, there would be nobody to provide policy continuity
 22:01 &lt; lilo&gt; jilles: but IRC networks are not supposed to have policy, either 8)
 22:01 &lt; jilles&gt; yes
 22:02 &lt; nick125&gt; usually, yes
 22:02 &lt; jilles&gt; most IRC networks have some kind of "democracy" among server admins
 22:02 &lt; lilo&gt; which usually means a lot of politics
 22:02 &lt; lilo&gt; and no fixed policy 8)
 22:02 &lt; BearPerson&gt; well, I suppose the compromise between traditionalist IRC and our point would be that the staffers abuse their authority to enforce policies&nbsp;;-)
 22:02 &lt; lilo&gt; because policy can change whenever
 22:02 &lt; lilo&gt; hehe BearPerson 
 22:02 &lt; jilles&gt; often with, in fact, some kind of veto for all admins
 22:02 &lt; nick125&gt; politics and IRC really dont mix real well in my opinion
 22:03 &lt; lilo&gt; they mix great, if by IRC we mean a medium that has no purpose 8)
 22:03 &lt; lilo&gt; they're a form of recreation for a certain sort of person, so that means that even running the network is recreational 8)
 22:04 &lt; BearPerson&gt; by the way, just very naively asking: What do the traditionalists do except not like the freenode philosophy?
 22:04 &lt; jilles&gt; nevertheless, traditional IRC networks still reach good stability
 22:04 &lt; lilo&gt; jilles: yes
 22:04 &lt; jilles&gt; they work
 22:04 &lt; lilo&gt; jilles: but that stability doesn't usually involve evolution toward a set of goals
 22:05 &lt; lilo&gt; jilles: not philosophical goals anyway
 22:05 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I mean, do they just try to get their way by DoS or something?
 22:05 &lt; BearPerson&gt; sounds not too smart
 22:05 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: usually it's politics
 22:05 &lt; jilles&gt; yes, because they already are what they want to be, I guess
 22:05 &lt; BearPerson&gt; such as?
 22:05 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: in 2002 people were passing around rumors about my finances to suggest that I was abusing the community
 22:05 &lt; jilles&gt; the stuff like efnet having too many useless US hubs?
 22:05 &lt; jilles&gt; or +CSr, csircd?
 22:06 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I see
 22:06 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: and belittling the idea that the network was something special, because no IRC network is supposed to be something special
 22:06 &lt; nick125&gt; well, even with the special goals, IRC is going to be IRC, no matter what you try to do
 22:06 &lt; lilo&gt; we're not IRC
 22:06  * BearPerson thinks N projects having their main channel here speak a different story&nbsp;:)
 22:06 &lt; lilo&gt; we're a discussion network
 22:06 &lt; BearPerson&gt; using the IRC protocol
 22:06 &lt; lilo&gt; we need to evolve in the direction of supporting more protocols
 22:06 &lt; BearPerson&gt; for as long as it suits us
 22:07 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: I'm not a protocol wonk
 22:07 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: I'm not a protocol advocate
 22:07 &lt; BearPerson&gt;&nbsp;?
 22:07 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: I'm an advocate of freenode, the institution
 22:07 &lt; nick125&gt; well, anything using the IRC protocol is considered a IRC network
 22:07 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: yes
 22:07 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: but what if we provide jabber group emulation to jabber clients, rfc1459 emulation to irc clients?
 22:07 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: gatewaying to aim clients?
 22:07 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: we should be protocol neutral
 22:07 &lt; nick125&gt; lilo: interesting point
 22:07 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: we're not about being an IRC network
 22:08 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: we are about being freenode, which is something of an institution
 22:08 &lt; nick125&gt; lilo: correct
 22:08 &lt; jilles&gt; there are problems there of course
 22:08 &lt; jilles&gt; like per-channel or per-network nicks
 22:08 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: the more traditional IRC people look at us and just get annoyed that we are not normal, the more we can support users who care about the network
 22:08 &lt; lilo&gt; jilles: yes
 22:08 &lt; BearPerson&gt; we'll always have to stay rather close to what the clients support I guess
 22:09 &lt; lilo&gt; jilles: but those problems can be solved at the client protocol emulation level I think
 22:09 &lt; nick125&gt; lilo: well, freenode isnt traditional IRC, but, its still IRC (well, least for now)
 22:09 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: if we regard ourselves as IRC, and act accordingly, we are not nearly annoying enough to tradirc people&nbsp;:)
 22:09 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I suppose people wanting to use it as plain IRC can do so
 22:10 &lt; lilo&gt; they can, but we are not a values-neutral network
 22:10 &lt; lilo&gt; we do want people who feel they are participating in a community
 22:10 &lt; lilo&gt; we need to make it less easy to use the network without getting involved
 22:10 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm
 22:10 &lt; lilo&gt; mind you, even just going to a channel and asking questions is a form of involvement
 22:10 &lt; lilo&gt; but running a warez channel is not
 22:11 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah
 22:11 &lt; lilo&gt; running a social channel that doesn't interact with the rest of the network is not
 22:11 &lt; BearPerson&gt; warez can be said to be against policies or laws
 22:11 &lt; lilo&gt; if the *members* of your social group aren't involved, that's a bad sign
 22:11 &lt; lilo&gt; a channel can be private, but does it help community people network?
 22:11 &lt; BearPerson&gt; but no social interaction does not violate any laws
 22:11 &lt; lilo&gt; yes
 22:11 &lt; lilo&gt; we're not values-neutral
 22:11 &lt; lilo&gt; we have to work not to be values-neutral
 22:12 &lt; BearPerson&gt; so we're actively shutting down isolated channels?
 22:12 &lt; lilo&gt; no
 22:12 &lt; lilo&gt; you foster trends
 22:12 &lt; nick125&gt; I think that would actually hurt the network more then help it
 22:12 &lt; lilo&gt; at some point, maybe it'll be hard to set up an isolated channel
 22:12 &lt; lilo&gt; but you don't thwap people
 22:12 &lt; nick125&gt; closing the warez channels would really help
</pre>
<a name="Secret_channels"></a><h3>Secret channels</h3>
<pre> 22:12 &lt; BearPerson&gt; taking away +s and +p might be interesting
 22:12 &lt; lilo&gt; we can make it a lot less interesting to run a warez channel here
 22:13 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: that maybe is still not subtle enough
 22:13 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm
 22:13 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: stick around, and watch me talk about these issues
 22:13 &lt; BearPerson&gt; recognize dcc commands and delay them by a minute&nbsp;:)
 22:13 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: I think you'll see what I mean
 22:13  * BearPerson sits back and gets out the popcorn
 22:13 &lt; nick125&gt; I would understand if someone wanted a secret channel for talking with fellow developers without the annoyance of general people there.
 22:13 &lt; BearPerson&gt; true
 22:14 &lt; jilles&gt; lilo, but you asked me earlier to change the initial mode for new chans from +n to +ns
 22:14 &lt; nick125&gt; ns wouldnt really make sense
 22:14 &lt; lilo&gt; jilles: yes
 22:14 &lt; jilles&gt; and, earlier, +i was enhanced to hide channels in whois
 22:14 &lt; lilo&gt; let me see if I can formulate this 
 22:15 &lt; lilo&gt; withholding public display from channels that aren't on topic can be helpful
 22:16 &lt; lilo&gt; there's an editorial function in providing them /list space
</pre>
<a name="No_ops_in_unregistered_channels"></a><h3>No ops in unregistered channels</h3>
<pre> 22:16 &lt; lilo&gt; another thing that can be done is not to provide ops to unregistered channels
 22:16 &lt; BearPerson&gt; now there's a point...
 22:16 &lt; lilo&gt; I'm throwing out things here that will irritate tradirc people
 22:16 &lt; BearPerson&gt; no ops could be a slight problem
 22:16 &lt; lilo&gt; not at all
 22:16 &lt; BearPerson&gt; who would register the channel?
 22:16 &lt; lilo&gt; either (1) anyone on the channel or (2) anyone, period
 22:16 &lt; lilo&gt; both have advantages
 22:17 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm
 22:17 &lt; lilo&gt; (2) makes it really a strong incentive to register your channel&nbsp;;)
 22:17 &lt; lilo&gt; but bear in mind, channel reg is still 'old school'
 22:17  * BearPerson would have expected "5 people longest time on the channel"
 22:17 &lt; nick125&gt; well, that would be like me walking into a channel with 5 people in it, unregistered, and talking it from them
 22:17 &lt; jilles&gt; which means forgetting to register can be a costly mistake!
 22:17 &lt; jilles&gt;&nbsp;:p
 22:17 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: yes
 22:17 &lt; nick125&gt; -l
 22:17 &lt; lilo&gt; jilles: and we can make it hard to forget
 22:17 &lt; lilo&gt; jilles: we can bug them about it as part of the automation&nbsp;;)
 22:17 &lt; lilo&gt; jilles: and not having ops is a reminder of sorts 8)
 22:17 &lt; nick125&gt; lilo: maybe reminders when they join it to register it?
 22:17 &lt; BearPerson&gt; some nice idea
 22:17 &lt; lilo&gt; but bear in mind, again, channel reg is still 'old school'
 22:18 &lt; lilo&gt; group reg is going to be different
 22:18 &lt; lilo&gt; it's going to emphasize real groups of people with real contact info
 22:18 &lt; lilo&gt; that will bug heck out of tradirc people
 22:18 &lt; lilo&gt; another thing that can be done
 22:18 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hehe
 22:18 &lt; lilo&gt; we have about channels
 22:18 &lt; nick125&gt; group reg? what about people that dont want to give out their contact information to someone they dont know?
 22:18 &lt; lilo&gt; what if we change the server algorithm for 'joining a nonexistent channel'
 22:18 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: we're a NFPO with a published privacy policy
 22:19 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: imagine the group of curmudgeons who cannot come up with a single person willing to provide contact info&nbsp;;)
 22:19  * BearPerson thinks about an "AntiChanServ" joining and de-opping any unregistered channel
 22:19 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: now imagine what network you want them on&nbsp;;)
 22:19 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: think built-in server features
 22:19 &lt; BearPerson&gt; now there's a reminder
 22:19 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: maybe they couldn't get ops at all&nbsp;;)
 22:19 &lt; BearPerson&gt; well, the only one with ops would be AntiChanServ
 22:19 &lt; jilles&gt; similar to how it works with splitmode
 22:20 &lt; BearPerson&gt; now there would be a painful reminder&nbsp;:)
 22:20 &lt; lilo&gt; BearPerson: ops is kind of an archaism
 22:20 &lt; jilles&gt; I actually like denying the join at all more
 22:20 &lt; lilo&gt; anyway, so, another idea
 22:20 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm
 22:20 &lt; nick125&gt; lilo: I think there should be both channel and group registration.
 22:20 &lt; BearPerson&gt; you need some kind of administration of channels possible
 22:20 &lt; lilo&gt; jilles: even better, is the idea of forwarding them to ##foo if they join #foo and it doesn't exist
 22:20 &lt; BearPerson&gt; and not by anyone
 22:20 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: we need group registration and channel *reservation*
 22:20 &lt; nick125&gt; it would drive people from the network to somewhere else where they can register a channel without the hassle
 22:20 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: note the differential emphasis
 22:21 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: most of our interesting channels are permanent
 22:21 &lt; BearPerson&gt; only one that can reserve a single-# only as a group?
 22:21 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: people join here to start them because they know freenode
 22:21 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: a single-page registration for a user and a group, including channel reservations, wouldn't be too hard
 22:21 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: 'fast track'
 22:21 &lt; lilo&gt; all of this stuff will drive away tradirc people
 22:21 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm
 22:22 &lt; lilo&gt; but most of our potential user base consists of people who have never used IRC
 22:22 &lt; lilo&gt; there are literally millions of them out there
 22:22 &lt; lilo&gt; we don't need to worry about running out of users
 22:22 &lt; BearPerson&gt; how would you go and specify channel "admins"...
</pre>
<a name="Registration_mindset"></a><h3>Registration mindset</h3>
<pre> 22:22 &lt; nick125&gt; I still dont think the idea of giving out personal information would attract users to register legit channels
 22:22 &lt; lilo&gt; what we need to worry about is whether our users will make the minimum contribution of saying "we are here because we want to be and because we like the service"
 22:23 &lt; BearPerson&gt; well, maybe the 3-user-channel would not register easily
 22:23 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: look at <a href="http://freenode.net/primary_groups.shtml" class='external' rel="nofollow">http://freenode.net/primary_groups.shtml</a>
 22:23 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: bear in mind I am *way behind* on registering groups
 22:23 &lt; nick125&gt; thats another issue too
 22:23 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: what you see is enough to populate a reasonable service of a not-for-profit org
 22:23 &lt; jilles&gt; there are indeed some projects that do not want a relationship with pdpc
 22:23 &lt; lilo&gt; jilles: indeed
 22:23 &lt; BearPerson&gt; but I think almost every group with &gt;10 users has a designated leader that has some known contact info anyway
 22:23 &lt; lilo&gt; jilles: and there are many IRC networks for them
 22:24 &lt; lilo&gt; jilles: we have to concentrate on maintaining a sustainable service
 22:24 &lt; lilo&gt; jilles: which means people have to want to be here, and they have to put their reputations on the line at least minimally
 22:24 &lt; lilo&gt; jilles: providing contact info gets them to commit to those things
 22:25 &lt; lilo&gt; jilles: that's the group registration paradigm
 22:25 &lt; BearPerson&gt; you're not just here for a week
 22:25 &lt; lilo&gt; talking to deedra
 22:25 &lt; jilles&gt; ok
 22:26 &lt; nick125&gt; what about someone that just wants to register a channel for a small little project? do you really want to have to call each and every one of those little tiny projects to make sure they are valid?
 22:28 &lt; nick125&gt; maybe a system of monitoring new channels for a few days could be better
 22:28 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm
 22:29 &lt; nick125&gt; it would be less hassle for people registering channels
 22:29 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah, people will want some kind of security/protection
 22:29 &lt; jilles&gt; as long as there's a huge backlog with the group registrations, I think you can't really require a group registration before registering a channel
 22:29 &lt; nick125&gt; if I had that hassle everytime, I wouldnt register channels. I wouldnt invite people over to freenode. I probably wouldnt even come onto freenode if that happened.
 22:29 &lt; BearPerson&gt; true
 22:30 &lt; jilles&gt; nick125, or, consider freenode as for "large projects" only
 22:30 &lt; jilles&gt;&nbsp;;p
 22:30 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm... first-come-first-serve is traditionalist... but also "works"
 22:30 &lt; BearPerson&gt; and how else would you do anything?
 22:31 &lt; nick125&gt; you dont want to force things onto users
 22:31 &lt; BearPerson&gt; and people will keep needing security for their channel without a lot of hassle
 22:32 &lt; nick125&gt; you should be able to register a channel without having to get a group registration
 22:32 &lt; BearPerson&gt; security meaning 1) it can't be reserved by anyone else
 22:32 &lt; BearPerson&gt; and 2) you can defend yourself against spamming etc.
 22:32 &lt; nick125&gt; lilo: if you think its bad now with group registrations, imagine it with 2,000-4,000 more applications
 22:32 &lt; BearPerson&gt; without 2) it would be a solution to just not hand out any rights at all...
 22:33 &lt; BearPerson&gt; a channel can't be taken from you when nobody can take it at all
 22:33 &lt; jilles&gt; BearPerson, ircnet's modeless +channels, haha
 22:33 &lt; BearPerson&gt; still has a bunch of issues
 22:33 &lt; nick125&gt; BearPerson: that would increase oper load, having to deal with each issue
 22:33 &lt; BearPerson&gt; probably too many
 22:34 &lt; BearPerson&gt; also, it doesn't even solve the first issue satisfactorily
 22:34 &lt; BearPerson&gt; people could still come in and just cold-shoulder the other people out
 22:35 &lt; BearPerson&gt; joining with many people and just starting to talk
 22:35 &lt; BearPerson&gt; people will want to know that the channel is going to be "theirs"... hmmmm...
 22:35 &lt; jilles&gt; one could think of providing certain facilities (not including banning) to registered groups only
 22:35 &lt; nick125&gt; jilles: such as?
 22:36 &lt; BearPerson&gt; the entire access list stuff
 22:36 &lt; jilles&gt; um, no
 22:36 &lt; BearPerson&gt; do non-group channels need anything more than just a list of 5 people that can get ops?&nbsp;;-)
 22:37 &lt; jilles&gt; that's still an access list then
 22:37 &lt; nick125&gt; jilles: I can understand cloaks and thinks like that, but, more then that is kinda unreasonable
 22:37 &lt; jilles&gt; or appearing in /list
 22:37 &lt; nick125&gt; thats just not reasonable in my mind
 22:38 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm
 22:38 &lt; jilles&gt; or other more advanced features like chanserv locking modes or the topic
 22:38 &lt; BearPerson&gt; only putting group channels in /list would be an idea
 22:38 &lt; BearPerson&gt; maybe a very good idea
 22:38 &lt; nick125&gt; jilles: what about trying to protect the channel?
 22:38 &lt; BearPerson&gt; cleans that list a lot
 22:38 &lt; nick125&gt; BearPerson: maybe only group channels in /list, but, /genlist (or something like that) would give you the whole damn list
 22:38 &lt; BearPerson&gt; nick125, well, if no strangers get ops you don't need to protect much
 22:38 &lt; jilles&gt; but I also think /list is one of the things that web interfaces are very suitable for
 22:39 &lt; nick125&gt; I do agree with the not-in-/list thing
 22:39 &lt; jilles&gt; it generates rather a lot of load on the IRC network
 22:39 &lt; nick125&gt; the /list usually shows the network from a distance
 22:40 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah, /list is something to go to a web interface, that seems a good idea
 22:40 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm... completely hiding just-plain-registered channels would greatly discourage warez channels
 22:41 &lt; nick125&gt; yes, but, without cutting the legit (yet not group registered) channel's neck
 22:41 &lt; BearPerson&gt; they wouldn't really be found too easily - which the users in it might not like
 22:41 &lt; nick125&gt; yep
 22:42 &lt; BearPerson&gt; so we'd be more or less agreeing that some sort of registration without hassle is needed
 22:42 &lt; nick125&gt; I think we should allow people to create channels without the hassle, yes, but, having /list and cloaks requires group registration
 22:43 &lt; BearPerson&gt; more summarizing, we need to encourage group registration without choking legit non-group channels
 22:43 &lt; nick125&gt; correctly
 22:43 &lt; jilles&gt; another thing could be a time limit
 22:43 &lt; nick125&gt; jilles: what kind of time limit?
 22:43 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm?
 22:43 &lt; nick125&gt; heres another idea:
 22:44 &lt; nick125&gt; non-group channels expire in 120 days
 22:44 &lt; jilles&gt; you may have access to certain facilities without group registration for a limited time only
 22:44 &lt; nick125&gt; group channels expire in 240 days
 22:44 &lt; BearPerson&gt; lol... trial time...
 22:44 &lt; nick125&gt; jilles: it still chokes the legit channels that dont need group registration
 22:44 &lt; jilles&gt; nick125, you can almost always make a group for the purpose
 22:45 &lt; jilles&gt; of the ops
 22:45 &lt; BearPerson&gt; well, making a group is what may be a little too much hassle
 22:45 &lt; nick125&gt; lets say theres a simple channel to talk about making a irc bot or something like that, they should be allowed to register their channel without these time-limits, etc
 22:45 &lt; nick125&gt; sounds more like microsoft kinda practices with the time-limits...lol
 22:46 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm... but these simple channels will mostly be small, won't they?
 22:46 &lt; nick125&gt; correct
 22:46 &lt; jilles&gt; could also force +l 25 on chans without group reg
 22:46 &lt; BearPerson&gt; so they don't need a lot of services
 22:46 &lt; jilles&gt; or something else than 25
 22:46 &lt; nick125&gt; BearPerson: but, they shouldnt be limited to it
 22:46 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm
 22:47 &lt; jilles&gt; BearPerson, that's the same idea I said earlier
 22:47 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah
 22:47 &lt; nick125&gt; what you dont want to happen is that people move legit projects to somewhere else
 22:47 &lt; BearPerson&gt; but it would naturally suggest a group registration as the project grows
 22:47 &lt; nick125&gt; by getting rid of all of the bad, you get rid of alot of the good too
 22:48 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I suppose
 22:48 &lt; nick125&gt; why not make it where you have to pay $10.95 to access the network? that still wouldnt get rid of warez though
 22:48 &lt; BearPerson&gt; can we somehow find some dividing lines where we can seperate warez channels from small project channels?
 22:49 &lt; BearPerson&gt; because without any differences we're really swinging in the dark
 22:49 &lt; jilles&gt; small ones
 22:49 &lt; jilles&gt; or ones that want to get a group reg but don't have one yet
 22:49 &lt; nick125&gt; I think we should allow the features of a full IRC network to smaller, not-group-registered channels, not restrict them down to the bare minimal
 22:50 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I mean, we need to keep in mind how the two differ before we think at all about how to seperate them
 22:50 &lt; BearPerson&gt; as nick125 said, you get rid of a lot of the good when getting rid of the bad, especially when you aren't specific
 22:51 &lt; jilles&gt; if the features we're going to offer still are sufficient for warez chans, we have made no progress
 22:51 &lt; BearPerson&gt; warez chans don't need much though
 22:51 &lt; nick125&gt; yep
 22:51 &lt; BearPerson&gt; warez chans would work without ops
 22:51 &lt; jilles&gt; except lots of people in a chan
 22:51 &lt; jilles&gt; including bots
 22:51 &lt; nick125&gt; they might need no modes
 22:52 &lt; nick125&gt; but, limiting people in a channel will also limit legit users
 22:52 &lt; jilles&gt; that's only the "ones that want to get a group reg but don't have one yet"
 22:52 &lt; BearPerson&gt; so one thing we already have... warez chans tend to have a lot more users
 22:53 &lt; nick125&gt; monitor channels that are not-group-registered with more then 25 people?
 22:53 &lt; BearPerson&gt; should work rather nicely
 22:53 &lt; BearPerson&gt; heh...
</pre>
<a name="Logging.2C_spying.2C_invisibility"></a><h3>Logging, spying, invisibility</h3>
<pre> 22:53 &lt; nick125&gt; if its legit (project or something), leave it alone, if it aint, close it down
 22:53 &lt; BearPerson&gt; offer channel logs as a "service" on the website
 22:53 &lt; BearPerson&gt; ask people to find the warez channels&nbsp;:)
 22:53 &lt; jilles&gt; BearPerson, that'll get them in search engines
 22:54 &lt; jilles&gt; I don't think that's a good idea
 22:54 &lt; nick125&gt; I got an idea: have freenode get special people to only check channels
 22:54 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah, maybe not
 22:54 &lt; nick125&gt; maybe 10-15 people
 22:54 &lt; BearPerson&gt; create an umode where you can /join channels without that getting told to clients
 22:55 &lt; jilles&gt; BearPerson, YUCK!!
 22:55 &lt; BearPerson&gt; basically invisible in channel
 22:55 &lt; jilles&gt; NO
 22:55 &lt; BearPerson&gt; only for opers of course
 22:55 &lt; nick125&gt; yes
 22:55 &lt; jilles&gt; I won't write "invisible join" code
 22:55 &lt; nick125&gt; or special channel snoopers to check channels
 22:55 &lt; nick125&gt; lol
 22:55 &lt; BearPerson&gt; actually, only for these 10-15 people
 22:55 &lt; nick125&gt; or have chanserv do it
 22:56 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm... I think the dancer docs mentioned +y: spy or something
 22:56 &lt; nick125&gt; where it will give the logs to the channel snoopers
 22:56 &lt; jilles&gt; BearPerson, +y is something totally different
 22:56 &lt; BearPerson&gt; or just forward them anything said there
 22:57 &lt; jilles&gt; +y notices opers when special commands such as /links and /trace are used
 22:57 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I mean, invisible join would basically only be "forward me any messages in the channel and tell me the users there"
 22:57 &lt; jilles&gt; while I don't like that either, it is not a significant threat to privacy
 22:57 &lt; alindeman&gt; I don't think we need an invisible umode
 22:58 &lt; RichiH&gt; indeed
 22:58 &lt; nick125&gt; have chanserv do it! 
 22:58 &lt; RichiH&gt; alindeman: ho, fellow lurker
 22:58  * nick125 waves to alindeman 
 22:58 &lt; BearPerson&gt; services can log or forward, sure
 22:58 &lt; alindeman&gt; I'm not sure we have a need to spy on channels
 22:58 &lt; RichiH&gt; we, that watch the channel in silence&nbsp;;)
 22:58 &lt; alindeman&gt; If there's a possible problem, we generally let people know
 22:58 &lt; BearPerson&gt; good point
 22:59 &lt; alindeman&gt; There's usually no reason not to
 22:59 &lt; BearPerson&gt; we should be open about what we do
 22:59 &lt; nick125&gt; hmm
 22:59 &lt; nick125&gt; yes
 22:59  * alindeman wonders who 'we' is&nbsp;;)
 22:59 &lt; RichiH&gt; generally speaking, it's a Bad Idea to give people even the trace of a doubt about if we are peeking into their private stuff without their knowing
 22:59 &lt; jilles&gt; staff can join a channel visibly to monitor it
 22:59 &lt; nick125&gt; alindeman: lol
 23:00  * BearPerson has just picked up the oper's way of speaking amongst themselves by hanging around here&nbsp;:)
 23:00  * RichiH thinks he would pretty much resign from staff if there started to be a secret, invisible chanlogger
 23:00 &lt; alindeman&gt; GXTi: THanks again for categorizing the stuff in the wiki
 23:00 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah, I guess that would be a dash back into Traditionalist-ism
 23:00 &lt; jilles&gt; BearPerson, hmm, no
 23:00 &lt; alindeman&gt; Other way around
 23:00 &lt; BearPerson&gt; "How to best keep a chaotic network under your whip"
 23:01 &lt; alindeman&gt; Too liberal, in fact
 23:01 &lt; alindeman&gt; Joining through bans is actually pretty liberal
 23:01 &lt; jilles&gt; secretly monitoring conversations is taboo in tradirc philosophy as well
 23:01 &lt; nick125&gt; though, we need a system for telling if channels are legit project channels or not
 23:01 &lt; RichiH&gt; jilles: unless you are in china&nbsp;;)
 23:01 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: Through registration ("registry")
 23:01 &lt; RichiH&gt; nick125: you can join and look at it
 23:01 &lt; GXTi&gt; alindeman: np
 23:02 &lt; nick125&gt; RichiH: yeah
</pre>
<a name="Unregistered_channel_status"></a><h3>Unregistered channel status</h3>
<pre> 23:02 &lt; alindeman&gt; In the future, # channels may not give op by default
 23:02 &lt; alindeman&gt; Things like that will discourage tradirc channels
 23:02 &lt; nick125&gt; how would they give op though?
 23:02 &lt; alindeman&gt; Through registration
 23:02 &lt; nick125&gt; channel registration?
 23:03 &lt; alindeman&gt; Group registration
 23:03 &lt; nick125&gt; or group registration?
 23:03 &lt; jilles&gt; how about denying the join completely
 23:03 &lt; nick125&gt; alindeman: ack, dont really like that idea myself
 23:03 &lt; alindeman&gt; Groups reserve channel namespace
 23:03 &lt; BearPerson&gt; denying join to non-group-channels?
 23:03 &lt; jilles&gt; create the channel fully through the web
 23:03 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: *apologetic look*
 23:03 -!- ashanks [~a@client-209-107-231-222.consolidated.net] has joined #freenode-registry
 23:03 &lt; RichiH&gt; jilles: dunno, seems a bit drastic, to me
 23:03 &lt; jilles&gt; have chanserv join it
 23:03 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: that's a bit too harsh
 23:03 &lt; BearPerson&gt; so only reserved channels would exist... hmm
 23:03 &lt; alindeman&gt; We don't need to necessarily get into implementation
 23:03 &lt; RichiH&gt; it has advantages, but..&nbsp;:p
 23:03 &lt; alindeman&gt; Right now
 23:04 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah, better just not give out ops unless it is registered
 23:04 &lt; nick125&gt; alindeman: I really think that would limit the network
 23:04 &lt; jilles&gt; RichiH, I think there's not much point in having people create channels that are opless by definition
 23:04 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: ordinary channels need to exist anytime, but turning off ops-on-join would discourage nonregistered channels.
 23:04 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: ... that being the point
 23:04 &lt; jilles&gt; mind, this would only apply to # chans
 23:04 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: quick discussions?
 23:04 &lt; GXTi&gt; oh...
 23:04 &lt; ashanks&gt; I know some Python.
 23:04 &lt; GXTi&gt; hm.
 23:04 &lt; RichiH&gt; jilles: you don't need ops for a quick-n-dirty channel for a meeting or some such
 23:04 &lt; jilles&gt; in my idea, ## chans would still give ops
 23:04 &lt; GXTi&gt; using channel names as a basis for denyable ability is a bit much.
 23:04 &lt; RichiH&gt; of course, people could always use ##
 23:04 &lt; alindeman&gt; jilles: Yah, I think that's where we're headed
 23:04 &lt; RichiH&gt; still, seems drastic, to me
 23:04 &lt; RichiH&gt; (the no-join-at-all)
 23:05 &lt; GXTi&gt; okay, that'd work.
 23:05 &lt; RichiH&gt; the no-ops might be a good idea, agreed
 23:05 &lt; nick125&gt; I think the op-requires-group-registration is harsh too
 23:05 &lt; GXTi&gt; #channels aren't joinable unless chanserv gets there first(maybe it sets +P to allow to open?)
 23:05 &lt; jilles&gt; there's still the "official-project-member-wants-meeting-chan" problem then
 23:05 &lt; GXTi&gt; nick125: not at all.
 23:05 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: That won't happen until we're a lot better organized and group registrations go quicker
 23:05 &lt; alindeman&gt; But, that's what we need to do
 23:05 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: registry would allow #group-* as well
 23:05 &lt; GXTi&gt; so if you wanted #gentoo-meeting, it'd be available.
 23:05 &lt; GXTi&gt; immediately.
 23:06 &lt; jilles&gt; that seems good
 23:06 &lt; nick125&gt; alindeman: it would create more problems then it would fix im my opinion
 23:06 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: *apologetic look*
 23:06 &lt; GXTi&gt; ##channels are open territory, though i'd suggest denying ops.
 23:06 &lt; GXTi&gt; just as a discouragement.
 23:06 &lt; alindeman&gt; There are some advantages to keeping 'traditional irc' stuff in some namespace
 23:06 &lt; alindeman&gt; Just not in the same namespace as official group channels
 23:07 &lt; GXTi&gt; not really my decision.
 23:07 &lt; nick125&gt; alindeman: first, it would add more load to the already stressed group registration department (uh, hi lilo), secondly it would limit legit channels, but, I do agree about the namespace thing, yes.
 23:07 &lt; GXTi&gt; so ##channels are up for grabs, #channels are denied join entirely?
 23:07 &lt; RichiH&gt; GXTi: as ## channels are not necessarily groups, you would have to take care of many many channels where they have problem users and can't op themselves..
 23:07 &lt; alindeman&gt; GXTi: I don't think so; more the no op on join
 23:07 &lt; GXTi&gt; RichiH: they should be groups though.
 23:07 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: See above
 23:07 &lt; RichiH&gt; alindeman: yah
 23:07 &lt; GXTi&gt; RichiH: even if they aren't the actual project
 23:07 &lt; alindeman&gt; ## channels are still groups
 23:07 &lt; GXTi&gt; brb.
 23:08 &lt; alindeman&gt; Just highly informal usually
 23:08 &lt; jilles&gt; alindeman, what's the point in such opless channels then?
 23:08 &lt; alindeman&gt; Still a group though
 23:08  * RichiH thinks it's utopic to have a group for each and every last channel on freenode
 23:08 &lt; BearPerson&gt; jilles, a quick-and-dirty channel
 23:08 &lt; jilles&gt; BearPerson, that's what ## is for
 23:08 &lt; BearPerson&gt; a less-quick-and-dirty channel is a registered one
 23:08 &lt; nick125&gt; alindeman: well, I think we should look at something a little bit less harsh then no ops, and if it becomes a overwelming problem, look into maybe no ops for a week or something like that.
 23:08 &lt; jilles&gt; to prevent naming issues, the channel would need to have a random name
 23:09 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: That doesn't seem to make sense
 23:09 &lt; jilles&gt; (not related to the project name because that would give up rights on it)
 23:09 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: If you want traditional IRC everywhere, go elsewhere
 23:09 &lt; RichiH&gt; jilles: the basic question is if you want to prohibt by default and allow some or vice versa, i guess
 23:09 &lt; ashanks&gt; Freenode is getting rid of ops?
 23:09 &lt; alindeman&gt; We want to make sure groups get the namespace they need, and they're encouraged to register
 23:09 &lt; BearPerson&gt; jilles, well, naming issues only exist when two people want the same name
 23:09 &lt; RichiH&gt; ashanks: you should read all of backlog&nbsp;;)
 23:09 &lt; jilles&gt; BearPerson, not in lilo's view
 23:09 &lt; jilles&gt;&nbsp;;p
 23:09 &lt; nick125&gt; alindeman: look at other methods of weeding out off-topic channels is pretty much what im saying
 23:09 &lt; BearPerson&gt; ashanks, currently it's really early discussion here&nbsp;:)
 23:09 &lt; alindeman&gt; BearPerson: Not where we're headed
 23:10 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: This is more subtle and will work better
 23:10 &lt; BearPerson&gt; we're discussing where we might be headed eventually
 23:10 &lt; ashanks&gt; But, is it in debate to drop ops totally?
 23:10 &lt; alindeman&gt; ashanks: No
 23:10 &lt; BearPerson&gt; not really I guess
 23:10 &lt; BearPerson&gt; you'll need someone to kick that spammer
 23:10 &lt; alindeman&gt; A blacklist approach like, deny people who are offtopic is not as good as a whiteless, allow people who are approach
 23:10 &lt; alindeman&gt; Anyway, the policy is really not in our hands
 23:10 &lt; nick125&gt; alindeman: that would work in my opinion, but, what about a gray list?
 23:11 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: There is, ## channels
 23:11 &lt; nick125&gt; so, have it where people have to have pretty much good karma to get a channel, bad people get put on a blacklist and cant get a # channel
 23:11 &lt; alindeman&gt; Or some other prefix, to be determined
 23:11 &lt; alindeman&gt; But ## is most akin to right no
 23:11 &lt; alindeman&gt; w
 23:11 &lt; nick125&gt; yeah
 23:11 &lt; GXTi&gt; nick125: overcomplicated.
 23:12 &lt; alindeman&gt; You're missing the point
 23:12 &lt; alindeman&gt; Groups get the namespace, not people
 23:12 &lt; alindeman&gt; Groups that may have used IRC before, or maybe not
 23:12 &lt; nick125&gt; GXTi: we could put a sign on the freenode door asking for $10.95 to access, that would be less complicated and freenode would get alot more donations&nbsp;:)
 23:12 &lt; alindeman&gt; Groups that may *not* use IRC much, or maybe a lot
 23:12 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: That's not a donation anymore
 23:12 &lt; alindeman&gt; It's called a 'fee'&nbsp;;)
 23:13 &lt; nick125&gt; alindeman: I know&nbsp;:)
 23:13 &lt; alindeman&gt; And we're not dropping the 'r' anytime soon&nbsp;:P
 23:13 &lt; GXTi&gt; feenode!
 23:13 &lt; nick125&gt; lol
 23:13  * GXTi registers.
 23:13 &lt; RichiH&gt; that joke is as old as the new name of opn
 23:13 &lt; alindeman&gt; The only nominal fee that could possibly be forseen is for a contracted out registration thing
 23:13 &lt; GXTi&gt; i know&nbsp;:/
 23:13 &lt; alindeman&gt; But it's possible that will not happen
 23:13 &lt; RichiH&gt; whoever comes up with freenude get a cookie
 23:13 &lt; alindeman&gt; (Verification)
 23:14 &lt; RichiH&gt; then, feenude
 23:14 &lt; GXTi&gt; alindeman: poor relations.
 23:14 &lt; alindeman&gt; It would expedite verification, but that's more a liloissue
 23:14 &lt; alindeman&gt; The policy on ops and channel namespace has been beaten to death anyway, I'm pretty sure what I've laid out is where lilo envisions heading
 23:14 &lt; GXTi&gt; still not very good relations, charging money for group use on the network.
 23:15  * RichiH bed
 23:15 &lt; RichiH&gt; night
 23:15 &lt; GXTi&gt; g'night.
 23:15 &lt; alindeman&gt; Would be nominal, might even be optional; not my department anyway; I just remember hearing something about the possibility
 23:15 &lt; GXTi&gt; thats an idea.
 23:15 -!- darthpwnt [the@alone.user] has joined #freenode-registry
 23:15 &lt; GXTi&gt; an expedition fee&nbsp;:)
 23:16 &lt; GXTi&gt; attach a donation to your group contact registration and it goes to the top of the list and stays there till its handled.
 23:16 &lt; nick125&gt; alindeman: I do think the whitelist/blacklist would work a little bit better (on resources also) then having every single person that wants ops to have to submit a group registration
 23:16 &lt; nick125&gt; lol
 23:16 &lt; alindeman&gt; GXTi: Heh
 23:16 &lt; nick125&gt; like alindeman said, that would be a fee, not a donation
 23:16 &lt; GXTi&gt; nick125: blacklisting again is overcomplicated, especially on hte implementation aspect.
 23:16 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: If your channel doesn't intend to be official, it shouldn't be in the same namespace as channels that are
 23:16 &lt; alindeman&gt; That's the point
 23:16 &lt; GXTi&gt; nick125: no, its optional.
 23:16 &lt; alindeman&gt; You're not "bad" if you don't want to be official, you just don't need to be in # namespace
 23:16 &lt; BearPerson&gt; yeah
 23:17 &lt; BearPerson&gt; revive &amp;chan&nbsp;;-)
 23:17 &lt; nick125&gt; GXTi: add a thing to chanserv
 23:17 &lt; alindeman&gt; BearPerson: It's a possibility, seriously
 23:17 &lt; GXTi&gt; nick125: chanserv cant deny access to channels, other than kickbanning people.
 23:17 &lt; alindeman&gt; It wouldn't mean "local channel," but lilo has mentioned it
 23:17 &lt; BearPerson&gt; the sense would be close though
 23:17 &lt; nick125&gt; GXTi: it wont deny access no, but, it would prevent ops and channel registrations&nbsp;:)
 23:17 &lt; BearPerson&gt; local channel and inofficial channel
 23:18 &lt; GXTi&gt; alindeman: i'm working out the implementation of #channel deny already&nbsp;:p
 23:18 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I think it would be rather easy to not give ops for the first joiner
 23:18 &lt; alindeman&gt; GXTi: Well, don't rush; we have to sort out registry before anything like this gets implemented
 23:18 &lt; GXTi&gt; alindeman: not incode, just in my head.
 23:18 &lt; alindeman&gt; Ah, kool
 23:18 &lt; GXTi&gt; i was thinking registry could join a registered channel and set +P
 23:18 &lt; alindeman&gt; Be sure to run anything by the wiki and then by lilo
 23:18 &lt; nick125&gt; maybe no ops on join, then, if you register the channel, you get ops....but, how would new users create channels?
 23:19 &lt; GXTi&gt; so the problem isny denying access, its denying creation.
 23:19 &lt; BearPerson&gt; nick125, web interface
 23:19 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: Chanserv is going away
 23:19 &lt; nick125&gt; alindeman: noooooo!&nbsp;:P
 23:19 &lt; GXTi&gt; registry simply doesn't do that check(its not a server), crates the channel(other servers accept), and sets +P.
 23:19 &lt; nick125&gt; alindeman: where is he going?
 23:19 &lt; GXTi&gt; +P is a good idea for registered channels anyway.
 23:19 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: All services go to heaven?&nbsp;;)
 23:19 &lt; GXTi&gt; alindeman: not dancer services&nbsp;:P
 23:19 &lt; alindeman&gt; Dancer may go to hell though
 23:19 &lt; BearPerson&gt; what was +Pagain?&nbsp;:)
 23:19 &lt; alindeman&gt; Yah&nbsp;;)
 23:20 &lt; nick125&gt; alindeman: lol
 23:20 &lt; GXTi&gt; BearPerson: permenant channel
 23:20 &lt; jilles&gt; persistent chan
 23:20 &lt; GXTi&gt; it doesnt get destroyed when its empty.
 23:20 &lt; jilles&gt; stays even if everyone leaves
 23:20 &lt; BearPerson&gt; ah, yeah... sounds like a good idea
 23:20 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: Throw away any current requirement for registration
 23:20 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: It doesn't matter
 23:20 &lt; BearPerson&gt; you reserve a channel on a web interface
 23:21 &lt; nick125&gt; well, that would be a hit point for auto bots
 23:21 &lt; alindeman&gt; Usually more like #name*
 23:21 &lt; GXTi&gt; but about working out the relation between a channel and a group... what if you want to start an official channel but the registration hasnt gone through immediately? the group registration that is.
 23:21 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: Autobots?
 23:22 &lt; GXTi&gt; do they start with ##foo and move to #foo later?
 23:22 &lt; BearPerson&gt; of course there will be some mechanism in IRC making something different because you reserved it, but that won't have to take registrations too
 23:22 &lt; nick125&gt; alindeman: ones that would bulk reserve channels
 23:22 &lt; BearPerson&gt; GXTi, why not
 23:22 &lt; BearPerson&gt; nick125, you can (try to) stop them
 23:22 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: Registration is becoming more dependent on real life things, as we have groups that do real life things; think <a href="http://freenode.net/group_contact_form.shtml" class='external' rel="nofollow">http://freenode.net/group_contact_form.shtml</a>
 23:22 &lt; BearPerson&gt; those nice warped numbers
 23:22 &lt; alindeman&gt; You're not going to be able to register blocks of channels without the basic info like that
 23:23 &lt; alindeman&gt; At least in official namespace
 23:23  * GXTi ponders the implementation of allowing #group-*
 23:23 &lt; jilles&gt; GXTi, hmm, there's some text in the policy saying: By registering an "about" channel, you indicate that you assert no legal or informal right to the channel name used. "About" channels should not be registered directly or indirectly by their corresponding projects.
 23:23 &lt; BearPerson&gt; well, careful IMO
 23:23 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: yes, but if #project is blocked and you're waiting for your contact to go through, the channel cant exist on #project
 23:23 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: so you have no choice but to use ##project
 23:24 &lt; jilles&gt; you can use ##3253
 23:24 &lt; alindeman&gt; Well, you may not have ops, but you will have a channel
 23:24 &lt; nick125&gt; alindeman: well, I could understand asking for email varification, but, requiring group registration seems to me being really limiting....there are people that dont feel comfortable giving their information out and having people they dont know calling them
 23:24 &lt; BearPerson&gt; there's a difference between making no claim to "##project"  and making no claim to "project"
 23:24 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: We haven't noticed that with most projects
 23:24 &lt; jilles&gt; that sucks but the ## channel may not contain the project anem
 23:24 &lt; ashanks&gt; Can't you just do it newsgroup style?
 23:24 &lt; BearPerson&gt; hmm?
 23:25 &lt; BearPerson&gt; what do you mean?
 23:25 &lt; ashanks&gt; If you don't want to pay $9 bucks for a domain through godaddy, you get a sub, like blah.uni.cc, well, you could have it web-style, where TLDs could be given (#blah), but for groups off-topic, will be #blah.subext
 23:25 &lt; jilles&gt; hierarchical names
 23:25 &lt; ashanks&gt; and so forth
 23:25 &lt; ashanks&gt; well, web or newsgroup.
 23:25 &lt; nick125&gt; alindeman: well, what about a channel for a small project, do you really think they want to go though the hassle of getting a group registration to even get ops in their channel? its hard enough to manage a project without dealing with group registrations.
 23:26 &lt; GXTi&gt; hrm.
 23:26 &lt; jilles&gt; nick125, well then they can do that on another network&nbsp;:P
 23:26 &lt; BearPerson&gt; we need to keep the small projects around too
 23:26 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: would it be terribly ugly when trying to create channel #foo-bar, to look up #foo?
 23:26 &lt; alindeman&gt; We have plenty of small groups that registered already
 23:26 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: to check if it exists already
 23:26 &lt; jilles&gt; GXTi, in ircd or services
 23:26 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: ircd
 23:26 &lt; jilles&gt; in services would be ok
 23:27 &lt; alindeman&gt; I'm looking at a channel with 2 people in it that we have a group contact form for
 23:27 &lt; BearPerson&gt; GXTi, depends - if you define the first dash to be a delimiter
 23:27 &lt; jilles&gt; GXTi, and what would we do with that?
 23:27 &lt; BearPerson&gt; s/a/the/
 23:27 &lt; nick125&gt; alindeman: but, do you see 100 channels like that/
 23:27 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: Yes, the majority of group contact forms are smaller channels and groups
 23:27 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: when project is registered, services would either join or +P #project, but when someone wnats to use #project-discussion or whatnot, we need to allow its creation even though it doesnt already exist.
 23:27 &lt; alindeman&gt; Vast majority, in fact
 23:28 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: im thinking of doing this limitation server-side so they don't get autokicked or something rediculous like that from the registry aspect.
 23:28 &lt; jilles&gt; GXTi, how does #project-discussion have something to do with #project then?
 23:28 &lt; BearPerson&gt; GXTi, I think we can define the dash as being group seperator
 23:28 &lt; nick125&gt; I could understand if you wanted group registration for cloaks and stuff like that, but, limiting ops to group registrated projects....warez channels can usually operate without ops so it really wouldnt help 
 23:28 &lt; BearPerson&gt; right
 23:28 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: #project-discussion would be a sub-channel of #project
 23:28 &lt; GXTi&gt; of
 23:28 &lt; jilles&gt; in what sense
 23:28 &lt; GXTi&gt; err.
 23:29 &lt; GXTi&gt; damnit&nbsp;:P
 23:29 &lt; jilles&gt; how does that affect ircd
 23:29 &lt; BearPerson&gt; anything with a dash in the name would be a subchannel probably
 23:29 &lt; jilles&gt; it would affect services of course
 23:29 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: It discourages group that are not willing to express a relationship with freenode
 23:29 &lt; alindeman&gt; groups *
 23:29 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: Which includes offtopic uses
 23:29 &lt; BearPerson&gt; jilles, we were thinking to disallow joins to a non-existing channel, right?
 23:29 &lt; jilles&gt; non-existing # channel
 23:29 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: assuming we are denying access to non-registered primary channels entirely, itd be best done from the ircd
 23:29 &lt; alindeman&gt; I don't think we're going to be disallowing joins
 23:29 &lt; nick125&gt; alindeman: discourage actual projects, yet, warez would probably go on without ops.
 23:30 &lt; BearPerson&gt; but joins to #group-quickdirty should still be allowed
 23:30 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: *apologetic look*
 23:30 &lt; alindeman&gt; You can clarify with lilo, but I don't think we're going to be throwing away JOINs
 23:30 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: but primary channels have offshoots, ie #gentoo, #gentoo-es, #gentoo-fr, that should be allowed even though "gentoo-es" isn't a registered project, it's PART of a registered project.
 23:30 &lt; alindeman&gt; Just maybe not +o by default
 23:30 &lt; alindeman&gt; GXTi: There's no reason we can't have "sub" group contacts
 23:30  * BearPerson thinks no +o by default is definitely a good idea
 23:30 &lt; GXTi&gt; this could result in some interesting namespacing.
 23:30 &lt; alindeman&gt; We have a few here already
 23:31 &lt; jilles&gt; GXTi, ircd doesn't know anything about "registered project" except for what channels exist
 23:31 &lt; GXTi&gt; hmm.
 23:31 &lt; jilles&gt; BearPerson, I don't agree
 23:31 &lt; alindeman&gt; Wikipedia has a #de.wikipedia contact, IIRC
 23:31 &lt; nick125&gt; I could understand -o until you got channel registration, that would be reasonable
 23:31 &lt; GXTi&gt; this all hinges on whether joins are denied to #channels
 23:31 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: Services is going away
 23:31 &lt; BearPerson&gt; I suppose they aren;t
 23:31 &lt; alindeman&gt; GXTi: Again, you can clarify with lilo, but I don't think we're heading there
 23:31 &lt; GXTi&gt; that's a critical point in this discussion.
 23:31 &lt; BearPerson&gt; alindeman, but registration/reservation isn't
 23:31 &lt; alindeman&gt; BearPerson: Right
 23:31 &lt; GXTi&gt; if not, fair enough.
 23:31 &lt; jilles&gt; I just don't see the point in opless channels
 23:32 &lt; nick125&gt; alindeman: I know that, yet, I think channel registration shouldnt go away
 23:32 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: meetings.
 23:32 &lt; BearPerson&gt; jilles, encourage signup
 23:32 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: Channel registration happens after group/project registration
 23:32 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: do you want to register a channel for a quick meeting?
 23:32 &lt; jilles&gt; use ##
 23:32 &lt; GXTi&gt; jilles: yes, ubt why should ##channels have ops unless they register?
 23:32 &lt; GXTi&gt; we want to encourage registration.
 23:32 &lt; nick125&gt; alindeman: what if someone doesnt want to do a group registration but still needs ops?
 23:33 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: *apologetic look*
 23:33 &lt; BearPerson&gt; who logs this today btw?
 23:33 &lt; jilles&gt; nick125, you're repeating yourself
 23:33 &lt; GXTi&gt; BearPerson: im still logging.
 23:33 &lt; jilles&gt; I do not
 23:33 &lt; GXTi&gt; im always logging&nbsp;:P
 23:33 &lt; alindeman&gt; Possible that the answer is "use another network"
 23:33 &lt; alindeman&gt; It's a valid one
 23:33 &lt; GXTi&gt; actually, im undecided on the ops on ## issue.
 23:33 &lt; nick125&gt; alindeman: well, thats probably not the thing freenode wants
 23:33 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: In some cases, it most certainly is
 23:33  * BearPerson drops off
 23:33 &lt; GXTi&gt; no ops would encourage contact registration, but ops would provide a traditional/testing enviroment.
 23:33 &lt; BearPerson&gt; nite guys
 23:34 &lt; GXTi&gt; night.l
 23:34 &lt; alindeman&gt; See ya
 23:34 &lt; nick125&gt; why let a few bad eggs spoil the batch?
 23:34 &lt; nick125&gt; BearPerson: cya
 23:34 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: I'm just not seeing empirical evidence that people are massively against registering when they have a bonified group
 23:34 &lt; alindeman&gt; I'm looking at hundred of group contact form submissions
 23:35 &lt; GXTi&gt; alindeman: would channel registration be a quick process assuming your contact is already taken care of?
 23:35 &lt; alindeman&gt; GXTi: Yes
 23:35 &lt; GXTi&gt; fair enough.
 23:35  * darthpwnt reads up
 23:35 &lt; alindeman&gt; You'd have a block of channels
 23:35 &lt; GXTi&gt; hm.
 23:35 &lt; alindeman&gt; Wildcards allowed
 23:35 &lt; alindeman&gt; (Verified with the group registration, of course)
 23:36 &lt; GXTi&gt; whats your recommendation for #channels with no registration?
 23:36 &lt; alindeman&gt; From there, you could manage whatever in that block
 23:36 &lt; GXTi&gt; no ops?
 23:36 &lt; alindeman&gt; You mean transitionally?
 23:36 &lt; GXTi&gt; finally
 23:36 &lt; nick125&gt; I think ops should be allowed without having to submit a group registration. thats just my opinion.
 23:36 &lt; GXTi&gt; nick125: im thinking that too for ##channels
 23:36 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: You've mentioned that many times&nbsp;;)
 23:36 &lt; alindeman&gt; GXTi: Possibly; you can clarify with lilo
 23:37 &lt; alindeman&gt; ## channels may still give ops
 23:37 &lt; nick125&gt; alindeman: well, I just dont think requiring group registration to even run a channel is logical. Thats my point 
 23:37 &lt; alindeman&gt; nick125: Noted
 23:38 &lt; nick125&gt; how about we leave the subject of group registrations for ops and talk about something else so I stop talking in circles?&nbsp;:)

<a name="Database_centralization"></a><h3>Database centralization</h3>
<pre> 23:40 &lt; nick125&gt; im thinking...for the main database, will it have a central database or will it use a replicated database?
 23:41 &lt; GXTi&gt; dunno. mechanics question.
 23:42 &lt; nick125&gt; replicated databases would reduce load when grabbing the information, but, it would require (number of servers) times more time for each change
 23:42 &lt; nick125&gt; or, it would replicate on a scheldule, but, then the databases would be uneven
 23:42 &lt; GXTi&gt; assuming registry is on one location, a replicated databse could be worthless.
 23:42 &lt; nick125&gt; you register a channel, and try to op in it: 'Channel not registered'
 23:43 &lt; GXTi&gt; except for backup.
 23:43 &lt; nick125&gt; thats not replication. thats called 'backing the system up before it does a total 360 and crashes the whole network'
 23:44 &lt; nick125&gt; the central database is probably going to be the option, yes

<a name="Non-registered_channel_denial"></a><h3>Non-registered channel denial</h3>
<pre> 00:08 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: what are your thoughts on non-registered #channels? should they be denied join entirely, or just denied ops?
 00:08 &lt; ashanks&gt; lilo, ok.&nbsp;:)
 00:08 &lt; lilo&gt; ashanks: the first 'changed' version was just a config change for number of file descriptors
 00:09 &lt; ashanks&gt; So you still wouldn't mind disclosing the source then...
 00:09 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: is that nonregistered channels, or specifically nonregistered ##channels?
 00:09  * lilo thinks
 00:09 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: #channels, not ##channels
 00:09 &lt; GXTi&gt; i'm thinking ##channels should have traditional behavior.
 00:09 &lt; lilo&gt; ashanks: not at all....I can package it up for you and hand it to you if you need it, but let me look at this tor situation first
 00:09 &lt; ashanks&gt; ok
 00:09 &lt; nick125&gt; lilo: I think that channel-registered should be allowed ops, even without group-registration. Even without ops, warez will still go though
 00:09 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: I dunno....we can *really* nail tradirc users by making them somewhat nontraditional too&nbsp;:)
 00:10 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: it's not just a warez issue
 00:10 &lt; nick125&gt; it seems to make it harder for legit projects
 00:10 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: it's a tradirc issue
 00:10 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: projects here tend not to need ops very quickly
 00:10 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; trafirc? traditional irc?
 00:10 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: what if you need to test a bot?
 00:10 &lt; lilo&gt; s/projects/groups/
 00:10 &lt; lilo&gt; darthpwnt: yes
 00:10 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; k
 00:10 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: ie kicking it or whatnot
 00:10 &lt; ashanks&gt; lilo, I know this sounds gay, but for anti-bot spam, use a brain. Make an IRC user answer a simple question, or respond with something, someway, just like registration validation where you enter the number of the image in the box ... the little code thingy.
 00:10 &lt; GXTi&gt; if oyu don't have contact access you can't register a channel to do it
 00:11 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: well, impromptu bot testing for a group that has never had a group registration? 8)
 00:11 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: could be a hobby bot
 00:11 &lt; lilo&gt; ashanks: yeah, thinking about that
 00:11 &lt; lilo&gt; ashanks: there are circumventions for that btw
 00:11 &lt; nick125&gt; lets say they need to kick a spambot or change the topic, it would be diffcult for them
 00:11 &lt; lilo&gt; ashanks: but I don't think anybody is much using them yet
 00:11 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: yes, but how hard is it to do a single-page registration?
 00:11 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: also a suggestion, allow people with group contacts to donate to move to the top of the list&nbsp;:)
 00:11 &lt; ashanks&gt; or you could just auto-kline any potential botspam.
 00:12 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: and registrations can tie into the incident tracking system to generate any needed verification; and there are services that can be used to verify personal info
 00:12 &lt; nick125&gt; lilo: wouldnt that add more load on the already streched freenode resources?
 00:12 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; so will #flood be like gone??
 00:12 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: hard to do that....that would be fee-for-service
 00:12 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; lol
 00:12 &lt; lilo&gt; darthpwnt: ##flood will certainly be around
 00:12 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; coo
 00:12 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: well, it's not so much a services as a kind repayment for hte donation&nbsp;:P
 00:12 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: that would be a service *grin*
 00:12 &lt; GXTi&gt; meh&nbsp;:p
 00:13 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: if it has potential economic value, it would be a service
 00:13 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: but focusing here on unregistered #channels
 00:13 &lt; lilo&gt; okay, here's what I'm thinking
 00:13 &lt; lilo&gt; and you have me ad libbing here
 00:13 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: deny access? forward to ##channel? don't give ops?
 00:13 &lt; lilo&gt; so don't take my comments as gospel, this is an example of things we can do
 00:13 &lt; nick125&gt; I still think that people would be kinda not to fond of the idea of giving their personal information just for ops. I could understand if the group wanted cloaks, etc.
 00:13  * lilo ruminates briefly
 00:13 &lt; GXTi&gt; we're full of ideas, we just need a decision 8]
 00:14 &lt; lilo&gt; ##foo channel .... provide access, set modes to +tns, you can't clear the +s, no ops
 00:14 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: nobody has to, give me a sec
 00:14 &lt; ashanks&gt; In my opinion you do it like web-hosting. For free projects, be like SF.net, and give them a channel like #whatever (normally would be whatever.sf.net).. for offtopic channels, things that aren't open source, etc, rent them a #com.whatever (be like a dot-com) for $9 a year
 00:14 &lt; lilo&gt; #foo channel.... forward to ##foo, set modes to +tns, you can't clear the +s, no ops
 00:14 &lt; lilo&gt; ashanks: we don't *want* to earn a lot of fee for service and encourage off-topic channels
 00:14 &lt; lilo&gt; ashanks: though "on-topic" is a bit broader than just FOSS
 00:15 &lt; lilo&gt; okay, nick125 
 00:15 &lt; GXTi&gt; perhaps even introduce a _third_ level of channels, where ###channels get ops but enforced +s?
 00:15 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: the group contacts need to provide specific contact info
 00:15 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: ouch 8)
 00:15 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: just for testing and the like
 00:15 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; lol
 00:15 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: let's not get too fancy 8)
 00:15 &lt; GXTi&gt; or harsh traditionalists.
 00:15 &lt; ashanks&gt; lilo, that's why the off-topic gets a #com.whatever, rather than a top level reserved-for-FOSS channel name.
 00:15 &lt; GXTi&gt; i think there needs to be a way to get ops on something without registration
 00:15 &lt; nick125&gt; lilo: I could understand asking for stuff like email address, etc, if they wanted ops in the channel.
 00:15 &lt; GXTi&gt; if for nothing else, for testing.
 00:15 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: harsh traditionalists.... erm.... I'm trying to figure out a diplomatic way to put this
 00:15 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: "Screw them"?
 00:15 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: well, that's up to the *groups*
 00:15 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: not at all
 00:15  * lilo thinks
 00:16 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: *grin*
 00:16 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: I don't want to offend anyone of a particular religious or ethnic culture, so I'm trying to think of a good example
 00:16 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: i'm liking hte redirect #foo to ##foo idea, i was thinking services(or whatever) could join #project and set +P on registration
 00:16 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: there are more traditional cultures and I want to draw a parallel there
 00:16 &lt; nick125&gt; lilo: Im talking about if the channel wants ops. from what im hearing, only groups that are registered with a full registration get the ability to get ops.
 00:16 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: maybe something about trying to offer television rentals to the Amish
 00:17 &lt; GXTi&gt; and then it's a basis of checking if #foo eists, if it does, allow join, if not, redirect to ##foo
 00:17 &lt; nick125&gt; lilo: yeah....television rentals to the amish would be a bad idea&nbsp;:P
 00:17 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: that's probably where we're heading, as modified by mid-course corrections due to some policy goal not being met
 00:17 &lt; GXTi&gt; i suppose if people really need to test their bot they can get on some other network.
 00:17 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: it's not that
 00:17 &lt; GXTi&gt; or befriend an op.
 00:17 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: you're talking about people who aren't spending time here, who come to test their bot
 00:17 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: we call those skript kiddies? 8)
 00:18 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: well if you're writing an irc bot(friendly or not, irrelevant) and you need to test something that involves an opped user, bot or otherwise interacting with it
 00:18 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: though I guess there are end-users who might not be part of a group who might want to
 00:18 &lt; GXTi&gt; it can be quite an inconvenience.
 00:18 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: but wouldn't that be a software project?
 00:18 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: it'd hardly be group-worthy
 00:18 &lt; GXTi&gt; as i've written quite a few bots myself, i know this.
 00:18 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: if you're writing a bot, you have a software project, and you'd register here or on another network, depending on whether you were comfortable on freenode
 00:18 &lt; nick125&gt; lilo: well, I still dont think you should require group-registration for simple op. I can understand if they want stuff like cloaks, etc, but, restricting ops would be kinda pethodic in my opinion.
 00:18 &lt; GXTi&gt; none of hte bots ive written have been worthy of releasing at all.
 00:19 &lt; GXTi&gt; let alone starting a group over.
 00:19 &lt; GXTi&gt; i'd nearly call that pollution of the group namespace, if such a thing exists.
 00:19 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: look around.... the channels which most use ops least subscribe to the freenode channel guidelines
 00:19 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: some of those channels do okay, and subscribe in spirit
 00:19 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: #gentoo-dev?&nbsp;;p
 00:19 &lt; nick125&gt; subscribe?
 00:19 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: but small channels in particular don't generally need ops here
 00:19 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; LOL
 00:19 &lt; GXTi&gt; there are always exceptions 8]
 00:20 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; so like, personal channels is off limits?&nbsp;:S
 00:20 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; i like to test my bots with dancer&nbsp;:/
 00:20  * ashanks renews #ashanks ... YOU'LL NEVER TAKE IT (hehe)
 00:20 &lt; GXTi&gt; well, what he's sugesting and im beginning to agree with is that ##channels are open to opless use
 00:20 &lt; nick125&gt; lilo: well, as the owner of a few small channels, they do need ops. what about if someone comes in and keeps changing the topic? you cant set +t because you dont have ops, and even if you have +t set, you couldnt change the topic yourself because you dont have ops.
 00:20 &lt; ashanks&gt; darthpwnt, #BotPark&nbsp;?&nbsp;:)
 00:20 &lt; GXTi&gt; so unless what you're testin g needs ops, you can keep doing so.
 00:21 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; lol
 00:21 &lt; GXTi&gt; nick125: the lock would be +nts
 00:21 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; nick125, read wat he said
 00:21 &lt; GXTi&gt; so the topic couldnt be changed at all.
 00:21 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; u wont need ops to set those modes
 00:21 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; as he said
 00:21 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; lol
 00:21 &lt; nick125&gt; GXTi: that includes the channel owner
 00:21 &lt; GXTi&gt; nick125: for unregistered channels, there is no owner as far as freenode is concerned.
 00:21 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; nick125, think out of the box
 00:22 &lt; nick125&gt; darthpwnt: well, I simply dont think that group registrations should be required for ops
 00:22 &lt; lilo&gt; +t might not be needed
 00:22 &lt; GXTi&gt; for registered channels, appropriately moded users can op up whenever they like to change whatever or deal with whatever.
 00:22 &lt; nick125&gt; lilo: if no one can change the topic, it shouldnt be needed.
 00:22 &lt; GXTi&gt; but unregistered hcannels should have minimal functionality.
 00:22 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: but minimal functionality us should be functionality within guidelines
 00:22 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: ops are not minimal functionality
</pre>
<a name="Breakage.2C_Cloaks"></a><h3>Breakage, Cloaks</h3>
<pre> 00:22 &lt; ashanks&gt; so how will all this screw up IRC clients?
 00:23 &lt; lilo&gt; ashanks: not too much
 00:23 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; lol
 00:23 &lt; GXTi&gt; ashanks: so far the worst is redirects.
 00:23 &lt; ashanks&gt; sure?
 00:23 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: and we're working on that
 00:23 &lt; GXTi&gt; and thats already being dealt with by several developers.
 00:23 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: yeah
 00:23 &lt; GXTi&gt; being/been
 00:23 &lt; GXTi&gt; xchat doesnt have a problem, irssi has fixes.
 00:23 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; ashanks, it wouldnt screw it up, it would just be different
 00:23  * lilo nods
 00:23 &lt; ashanks&gt; cloaks alone would probably bug one client, not expecting whatever/user instead whatever.user
 00:23 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; doubtful
 00:24 &lt; nick125&gt; I simply think that requiring group registrations for op is going to hurt freenode more then help it keep clean, but, thats just my opinion on this issue.
 00:24 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; cloaks are a server thing i would think
 00:24 &lt; ashanks&gt; X-Chat Aqua always gets bugs, scrooge.&nbsp;:)
 00:24 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; lol
 00:24 &lt; GXTi&gt; ashanks: someone would fix it
 00:24 &lt; ashanks&gt; GXTI, if you say so. ok.
 00:24 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; thats true to. xchat ppplz are on freenode
 00:24 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; they'd fix it fast
 00:24  * lilo nods
 00:24 &lt; lilo&gt; I think they would
 00:24 &lt; nick125&gt; yeah
 00:24 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: bear in mind that we can accept some hurt to get to a better policy place
 00:25 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; unless there closet irssi users themselves
 00:25 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; lmao
 00:25 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: we don't insist that everybody be here
 00:25 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: never have, and there are a variety of alternatives
 00:25 &lt; GXTi&gt; i think itd be interesting to get a version scan on various irc client channels.
 00:25 &lt; darthpwnt&gt;&nbsp;:P
 00:25 &lt; GXTi&gt; see what percent of the channel staff use a different client&nbsp;:P
 00:25 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; especially from the devs
 00:25 &lt; darthpwnt&gt;&nbsp;:P
 00:25 &lt; nick125&gt; lilo: hurt it more then help it, plus, it seems it would drain resources just processing the applications
 00:25 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: I think we have a database of 1/3 million raw version hits
 00:25 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: they're hard to process though
 00:25 &lt; GXTi&gt; indeed.
 00:25 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; lol
 00:26 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: they're not hard to process once we get things in order
 00:26 &lt; nick125&gt; lilo: one question for you: how many channels are on freenode at the moment?
 00:26 &lt; ashanks&gt; 	-lilo-	VERSION I have it here somewhere
 00:26 &lt; ashanks&gt; lol
 00:26 &lt; nick125&gt; and how many of those already have group registrations in place.
</pre>
<a name="Channel.2C_group_statistics_.26_impact"></a><h3>Channel, group statistics &amp; impact</h3>
<pre> 00:27 &lt; lilo&gt; about 5,000 visible channels, about 8,400 total
 00:27 &lt; lilo&gt; we're probably behind 400 or so on the applications and have 120 or so done
 00:27 &lt; nick125&gt; ok, and, how long would it take you to go and process a group registration for each and every single of those channels?
 00:28 &lt; lilo&gt; probably a week on the backlog, I've just been concentrating on other stuff
 00:28 &lt; GXTi&gt; i think there should be more people processing group contacts, at least one.
 00:28 &lt; lilo&gt; but bear in mind, there are a lot of empty channels on that list
 00:28 -!- TFKyle [kyle@hsdbrg64-110-237-125.sasknet.sk.ca] has joined #freenode-registry
 00:28 &lt; lilo&gt; let me see if I can qualify the list some
 00:28 &lt; ashanks&gt; lilo, why all this change? What is wrong with Chanserv?
 00:28 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; finally. lol
 00:28 &lt; GXTi&gt; well, if its only a week backlog
 00:28 &lt; GXTi&gt; then i suppose thats not too bad
 00:29 &lt; GXTi&gt; ashanks: chanserv doesn't fit the direction lilo is taking hte network in.
 00:29 &lt; lilo&gt; we have 2,300 or so channels with at least 5 users
 00:29 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; heh
 00:29 &lt; lilo&gt; and how many of those really need ops?
 00:29 &lt; ashanks&gt; GXTi, an IRC network without a Channel Services bot on the IRC protocol is non-existant.
 00:29 &lt; lilo&gt; and how many of those are isolated, traditional IRC channels with no connection to the life of the network?&nbsp;;)
 00:29 &lt; nick125&gt; ashanks does have a point. the current method works okay, and yes, it might allow off-topic channels, but, it still works
 00:29 &lt; lilo&gt; not so much the &gt;5 channels, but the &lt;5
 00:30 &lt; nick125&gt; lilo: well, every channel needs op at some time or another
 00:30 &lt; GXTi&gt; ashanks: because it's time for a change. this will effectively provide the same functionality as services, but services itself will be gone.
 00:30 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: most of the small channels that need ops, need ops because they brought along some kiddie problems from another network
 00:30 &lt; ashanks&gt; yes, this one would if darthpwnt said what he really wanted to say about this whole idea right now&nbsp;:)
 00:30 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: the more they need ops, the more likely they are to be offtopic
 00:30 &lt; darthpwnt&gt;&nbsp;?
 00:30 &lt; nick125&gt; I think ashanks is talking about the policy of ops and registration
 00:31 &lt; ashanks&gt; darthpwnt, about every channel needing an op ...
 00:31 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; oh
 00:31 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; hey, this aint my network. wateva they decide, cant do nothing about ^_^
 00:31 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; can try to influence but thats about it
 00:31 &lt; nick125&gt; if you find a unoffical channel, make them forward it
 00:31 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; its one of those "if u dont like it, theres the door" things
 00:32 &lt; nick125&gt; have a special team of people doing little checks of channels once in a while.
 00:32 &lt; nick125&gt; no matter what, offtopic channels will get in, and you will still have the same problem all over again
</pre>
<a name="Unregistered_channels_revisited"></a><h3>Unregistered channels revisited</h3>
<pre> 00:32  * lilo shrugs
 00:32 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: most channels do need ops at some point, with size comes a  following of less mature "users" who tend to cause problems, as im sure you're quite aware.
 00:32 &lt; lilo&gt; if we spend a lot of effort getting official channels forwarded to unofficial channels, that's going to be a headache
 00:33 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: as i see it, that won't be a big issue.
 00:33 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: sooner or later, but I've seen 10 person channels simply not need ops until they got to be much larger
 00:34 &lt; nick125&gt; not meaning to be stubborn, just trying to get you to relize that it would be simplier to keep the current policy for channel registration then requiring group registration for ops, for the users and freenode.
 00:34 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: simply prevent #channels from being created
 00:34 &lt; lilo&gt; think of the web interface as being something like sf.net
 00:34 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: registry creates them, flags iwth +P, and leaves(or doesnt leave)
 00:34 &lt; nick125&gt; (simplier for users and freenode)
 00:34 &lt; lilo&gt; GXTi: better to forward to unofficial channels
 00:35 &lt; GXTi&gt; lilo: yes, they're not created and the user gets a forward.
 00:35 &lt; GXTi&gt; if the channel doesn't already exist, forward. simple.
 00:35 &lt; nick125&gt; heres an idea: have it where you have to get approved to get a #, otherwise, you get a ##
 00:35 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: that's certainly under consideration
 00:36 &lt; lilo&gt; nick125: and maybe it does make sense to leave ##foo traditional
 00:36 &lt; GXTi&gt; but #channels are specifically designated for official project channels.
 00:36 &lt; nick125&gt; yup
 00:36 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; all those domain names that people registered&nbsp;:S
 00:36 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; hashweb.com i think is one
 00:36 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; hashhashweb.com
 00:36 &lt; nick125&gt; group registration shouldnt be mandatory for ops.
 00:36 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; lol
 00:36 &lt; nick125&gt; lol
 00:37 &lt; nick125&gt; maybe have it where group registrations are mandatory for group cloaks, etc, like it is now
 00:37 &lt; GXTi&gt; i'm quite well attached to having #foo for project groups only, period.
 00:38 &lt; nick125&gt; maybe there should be this:
 00:38 &lt; GXTi&gt; as for ##foo, i could go either way on giving ops on join.
 00:38 &lt; nick125&gt; ## channels - unoffical channels, must be channel registered for ops
 00:39 &lt; nick125&gt; # channels - unoffical channels (but, no one else is in the namespace), must be channel registered for ops
 00:39 &lt; nick125&gt; # channels - group registered channels, gets rights to namespace, gets ops
 00:39 &lt; lilo&gt; can't have both groups on #foo channels
 00:39 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; yea
 00:39 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; u duped it
 00:39 &lt; darthpwnt&gt;&nbsp;:|
 00:39 &lt; lilo&gt; if you're going to make a distinction between official and unofficial groups, it has to be consistent
 00:39 &lt; nick125&gt; well, it would be like someone opening a # channel without getting a group registration
 00:40 &lt; ashanks&gt; lilo, unofficial? But how would you determine a group is unofficial?
 00:40 &lt; darthpwnt&gt; ##
 00:40 &lt; nick125&gt; and someone else opening a # channel and getting a group registration
 00:40 &lt; GXTi&gt; ashanks: when they don't provide group contact info.
 00:41 &lt; nick125&gt; the no-group-registration no-ops doesnt make sense to me.
 00:41 &lt; lilo&gt; ashanks: I see

 14:29 &lt; lilo&gt; some highlights of freenode-registry
 14:29 &lt; lilo&gt; it replaces services, but it's not really about replacing services
 14:29  * lilo thinks about how to avoid speaking in conundrums
 14:30 &lt; argtor&gt; grin
 14:30 &lt; lilo&gt; here we are, freenode is IRC; it's also not as effective as it could be
 14:30 &lt; lilo&gt; we don't need to be just IRC
 14:30 &lt; lilo&gt; we do need to be an effective environment
 14:30 &lt; lilo&gt; I would say already we do a heck of a lot better than most IRC in terms of hosting serious and useful activity
 14:30 &lt; lilo&gt; it's just that considerably more is possible
 14:31 &lt; lilo&gt; so, freenode registry
 14:31 &lt; lilo&gt; an authentication and authorization framework
 14:31 &lt; lilo&gt; the basic framework should be very simple and modular
 14:31 &lt; lilo&gt; the most important entities are users and groups
 14:31 &lt; lilo&gt; the orientation here is that we are always talking about real people in the real world
 14:31 &lt; lilo&gt; users are individual human beings
 14:32 &lt; lilo&gt; groups are formal (legal) or informal entities which are populated by human beings, again, in the real world
 14:32 -!- HostingGeek [~HG@200.48.233.220.exetel.com.au] has joined #freenode-registry
 14:32 &lt; HostingGeek&gt; COOL!!!!
 14:32 &lt; housetier&gt; I shall read the wiki most thouroughly
 14:32 &lt; HostingGeek&gt; Nice too see freenode working on it at last!
 14:32 &lt; marienz&gt; I've skimmed through the wiki a bit
 14:33 &lt; lilo&gt; HostingGeek: be fairly quiet, I'm, erm, doing the lecture thing 8)
 14:33 &lt; lilo&gt; marienz: *nod*
 14:33 &lt; HostingGeek&gt; lilo: PM?
 14:33 &lt; lilo&gt; HostingGeek: give me a few minutes
 14:33 -!- MSameer [~strcat@212.103.170.133] has joined #freenode-registry
 14:33 &lt; lilo&gt; okay, so
 14:33 &lt; lilo&gt; freenode registry is a modular authentication and authorization framework
 14:34 &lt; lilo&gt; it's oriented around users and groups
 14:34  * lilo catches MSameer up
 14:34 &lt; lilo&gt; users are individual human beings in the RL
 14:34 &lt; lilo&gt; erm real world
 14:34 &lt; lilo&gt; groups are external entities, registered legal entities or informal working groups
 14:35 &lt; lilo&gt; once the basic framework is coded, we start adding *facilities*
 14:35 -!- reagent [mathias@ina.weyland.ch] has joined #freenode-registry
 14:35 &lt; lilo&gt; adding a facility allows you to assign objects and privileges pertaining to that facility to users and groups
 14:35 &lt; lilo&gt; here's an example
 14:35 &lt; lilo&gt; assume we have an 'irc' facility
 14:35 &lt; lilo&gt; we can reserve nicks to users
 14:36 &lt; lilo&gt; we can reserve channels to groups
 14:36 &lt; lilo&gt; we can provide each user with certain configurable variables pertaining to the irc network
 14:36 &lt; lilo&gt; and provide each group with configurable variables pertaining to the network, and to individual channels
 14:36 &lt; lilo&gt; they can delegate capabilities to users who are partw of their group
 14:37 &lt; lilo&gt; so, you have some group, call it the Gentoo Foundation
 14:37 &lt; lilo&gt; a board member registers as a registry user
 14:38 &lt; lilo&gt; there's a minimum verification, probably an email return
 14:38 &lt; lilo&gt; then they go to register Gentoo Foundation
 14:38 &lt; lilo&gt; since they're a board member, they are clearly an 'approving contact'
 14:38 &lt; lilo&gt; which is what you need to start with
 14:38 &lt; lilo&gt; in order to register their group, they provide verified RL contact info
 14:39 &lt; HostingGeek&gt; lilo: Just one note that you know but some others might not: The framework is the main part so if its poorly coded it will effect the whole project and it will make it harder to manage and add features so make sure the framework is modular
 14:39 &lt; lilo&gt; again, the emphasis is on real people in the real world, something IRC frequently lacks
 14:39 &lt; lilo&gt; HostingGeek: thanks, but let me go on 8)
 14:39 &lt; lilo&gt; now, if you look on the policy page you'll see some changes in the works
 14:39 &lt; lilo&gt; we're moving to a two-namespace channel system
 14:39 &lt; lilo&gt; #foo for names for which groups have an external claim
 14:40 &lt; lilo&gt; ##foo for names for which they don't
 14:40 &lt; lilo&gt; Gentoo Foundation would clearly own #gentoo
 14:40 &lt; lilo&gt; anyone can own ##gentoo
 14:40 &lt; lilo&gt; in fact, GF would be discouraged from owning ##gentoo
 14:40 &lt; lilo&gt; so, the next thing the group contact for GF does is request #gentoo and #gentoo-*
 14:41 &lt; lilo&gt; there's an editorial function for the #foo space, designed to make sure name owners really are the ones who end up owning the corresponding channel name
 14:41 &lt; lilo&gt; they clearly are the name owner
 14:41 &lt; lilo&gt; so now they have "services-like" control for both #gentoo and anything starting with #gentoo-
 14:42 &lt; lilo&gt; they
 14:42 &lt; lilo&gt; the irc facility will give them capabilities which can be provided to individual users to manage their whole range of channels, or a single channel
 14:42 &lt; lilo&gt; they can instantiate individual channels or have a default set of modes and permissions applying to any channel anyone enters in their namespace
 14:43 &lt; lilo&gt; a facility in freenode-registry is a set of named capabilities and configuration variables which can be applied to reserved objects
 14:43 &lt; lilo&gt; the tentative database schema describes each capability exhaustively, but that's sort of a 'data dictionary' function
 14:44 &lt; lilo&gt; it's expected that the web interface will have facility-specific modules
 14:44 &lt; lilo&gt; and each of those will be responsible for 'talking to' the corresponding application system
 14:44 &lt; lilo&gt; check the wiki for some initial information, including the latest sql schema
 14:44 &lt; lilo&gt; it may be overnormalized
 14:45 &lt; lilo&gt; or it may not; it's initially intended for postgresql, which is reasonably powerful; and mysql improves all the time
 14:45 &lt; lilo&gt; okay, so, 'irc' is a facility
 14:45 &lt; lilo&gt; other intended facilities:
 14:46 &lt; lilo&gt; a 24/7 volunteer scheduling application, with real time notification for staffers and tie-ins to IRC as well as email and other notification methods
 14:46 &lt; lilo&gt; it's designed to nail down who is on shift at any given time
 14:46 &lt; lilo&gt; it's primarily intended for the use of freenode itself but may be handy to other 24/7 infrastructure projects
 14:46 &lt; Astinus&gt; OOoOooh&nbsp;:P   Funky&nbsp;:)
 14:47 &lt; lilo&gt; an incident tracking application system, which ties into the volunteer scheduling system and IRC to provide real-time notifications of new problems, and escalations after a maximum triage time and a maximum time-to-resolution
 14:47 &lt; lilo&gt; there are lots of incident tracking systems out there, it may be we can dovetail something that already exists
 14:47 &lt; lilo&gt; a facility module for freenode-registry itself, designed to allow its administration
 14:48 &lt; lilo&gt; there are some other facilies we could eventually provide
 14:48 &lt; lilo&gt; blogging for project members
 14:48 &lt; lilo&gt; tie-ins to project hosting services
 14:48 &lt; lilo&gt;  
 14:48 &lt; lilo&gt; I should comment on the orientation and goals of this for freenode
 14:48 &lt; lilo&gt;  
 14:49 &lt; lilo&gt; freenode is not about IRC
 14:49 &lt; lilo&gt; it's about providing a discussion service for project coordination and support
 14:49 &lt; lilo&gt; there's a subtle difference
 14:49 &lt; lilo&gt; here's my attitude on client protocols: "I don't care"
 14:49 -!- vortec [~vortec@dsl-084-059-140-218.arcor-ip.net] has joined #freenode-registry
 14:50 &lt; lilo&gt; eventually I expect we'll have a server that supports irc, jabber, and a variety of instant messaging protocols
 14:50 &lt; lilo&gt; let the users decide what they want to use
 14:50 &lt; lilo&gt; freenode is an entity and an institution with a purpose, and that purpose is not to be an advocate for client protocols
 14:50 &lt; lilo&gt; I want to make sure as many people as possible can potentially connect and use the service
 14:51 &lt; lilo&gt; and that eventual server implementation will just be another freenode-registry facility
 14:51 &lt; lilo&gt;  
 14:51 &lt; lilo&gt; okay, what freenode and its users get out of freenode-registry; in particular, volunteer scheduling and incident tracking
 14:52 &lt; lilo&gt; we're stuck right now.... we can't expand staff very quickly, because we have no effective staff evaluation system
 14:52 &lt; lilo&gt; freenode-registry's facilities will allow us to schedule people to be on duty
 14:53 &lt; lilo&gt; it'll allow us to respond quickly to incidents filed by users, or know if we are not responding quickly, and know who didn't respond&nbsp;;)
 14:53 &lt; lilo&gt; it'll allow us to single out people who are really good at serving the public, and allow all of us to improve our skills
 14:53 &lt; Astinus&gt; Staffer of the Month!
 14:53 &lt; lilo&gt; it'll allow us to provide backup for staffers on duty, and know what times of day we have light and heavy coverage
 14:54 &lt; lilo&gt; in other words, it'll provide us the ability to operate efficiently as the serious service we are intended to be
 14:54 &lt; lilo&gt; it will also help us change the paradigm a bit
 14:55 &lt; lilo&gt; right now there are two general groups of people on freenode
 14:55 &lt; lilo&gt; there are people who have previous IRC experience, who come in expecting and believing that we must be the usual, not-very-serious IRC network
 14:55 &lt; lilo&gt; there are people who have no previous IRC experience, who come in and, if they stay, pretty much see us as what we are intended to be
 14:55 &lt; lilo&gt; a relaxed, serious environment for people in our target communities to do what they do
 14:56 &lt; lilo&gt; we're limited in our ability to provide a serious service by the perceptions of the traditional IRC people sprinkled throughout our population
 14:57 &lt; lilo&gt; changing the paradigm means that those people get to decide between using us, for reasons which have to do with the services and goals we espouse, and simply going on to some more traditional IRC network, because it better suits their needs
 14:57 &lt; lilo&gt; it leaves us free to pursue a serious agenda
 14:57 &lt; lilo&gt;  
 14:58 &lt; lilo&gt; okay, that's most of my intro, though I will assure you all that I have hours and hours of answers to specific questions about how the implementation can look, and I'm much more concerned with getting something that fills our needs than anything else 8)
 14:58 &lt; lilo&gt;  
 14:58  * lilo opens up the floor again

<a name="Single_channel_permissions"></a><h3>Single channel permissions</h3>
<pre>(12:09:10) &lt; *GXTi&gt; okay, so essentially what would happen is for a capability, let's say topiclock override...
(12:09:37) &lt; alindeman&gt; You'd have a hyperion facility, and a capability for topiclock
(12:09:39) &lt; *GXTi&gt; you'd create a provided_boolean with a channel_id set to the channel and user_id set to the user.
(12:09:58) &lt; alindeman&gt; You might not need boolean; just that a record exists in provided might be good enough
(12:10:10) &lt; alindeman&gt; Unless we implement some sort of explicit deny
(12:10:12) &lt; *GXTi&gt; but what i don't understand is how you can delegate permissions to invididual channels when channel can hold wildcards.
(12:10:14) &lt; alindeman&gt; Which might be useful actually
(12:10:23) &lt; alindeman&gt; GXTi: The channel table ...
(12:10:38) &lt; alindeman&gt; mmmmmmmmm
(12:10:39) &lt; *GXTi&gt; alindeman: the channel table uses wildcards to specify a group's channel ownership.
(12:10:49) &lt; alindeman&gt; It's something to consider yah
(12:11:05) &lt; *GXTi&gt; maybe the allowed range of channels should be moved to a group detail or provided
(12:11:21) &lt; *GXTi&gt; then channel will be used exclusively for individual channels
