Operspy (local with accountability) [2/3]

This vote covers the following capabilities:

- See all +i clients in /who
- See all clients on +s/+p chans
- See +s/+p channels in /whois
- See channel keys/modes

This is one of three related votes.  Whichever one vote has
the largest number of YES responses, will be considered
passed.  The other two will be considered nullified.

If this vote passes, the above capabilities will be built
into each ircd.  The ircd will broadcast a notice as done
with /kill, bound to a usermode, for accountability.
Policy dictating who will be given accounts will be left to
the discression of each admin unless voted otherwise in the
future.

Unless further policy is voted in at a later date, these
capabilities may only be used to combat drones.  Abuse of
these capabilities will be handled on a case-by-case basis
just as would abuse of /kill, /squit, sniffing, chanfix,
etc (again, until further policy is voted in at a later
date -- perhaps concurrently with these 3 votes!).
