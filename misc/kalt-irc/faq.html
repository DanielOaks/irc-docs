<P><LI><B>What versions of IRCD does this FAQ cover?</B></P>
This FAQ was started in february 1997.  At that time, irc
2.9.2 was the current version, and 2.9.3 in beta.
Hopefully, the FAQ will always be updated to cover the
latest version.
<P>
Versions 2.10.x will soon be covered.

<P><LI><b>Who writes IRCD?</B></P>
<em>Christophe Kalt</em> &lt;<A HREF="/web/20020408131601/mailto:kalt@stealth.net">kalt@stealth.net</A>&gt;,
is the current maintainer.<p>
There are several other people working on IRCD, and helping
testing it.  The list of contributors is long, and can be
found in the packages, or by issuing an INFO command to the
server.
<A NAME="ircd-2">
<P><LI><b>Where is the protocol documented?</b></P>
The <A HREF="/web/20020408131601/http://www.stealth.net/~kalt/irc/rfc1459.html">RFC 1459</A> is the best
documentation about the IRC protocol.  Note that this
document is experimental and outdated.  In particular,
version 2.9 and higher introduce many new extensions and
changes.
<p>
If something is not documented anywhere, the best way to
find about it is to RTFS.  Developers are known to often use
this answer.  I do sometimes, either because I really don't
have the time to answer such an (easy) question, or simply
because <em>I do not know the answer myself</em>.  The code
is huge, I don't know everything, and forget about some of
the things I wrote myself.
<A NAME="ircd-3">
<P><LI><b>Where can I find more information about it then?</b></P>
First of all, you should look in the <b>doc</b> directory.
Lots of information is there.  Check the README as a
starting point.

<H1>Miscellaneous common questions</H1>

<ol><ol>
<A NAME="misc-1">
<P><LI><B>What server versions can I connect my 2.9.x server to?</B></P>
2.9.x are fully compatible with 2.8.x servers.  Be sure to
<A HREF="/web/20020408131601/http://www.stealth.net/~kalt/irc/config.html#NoV28">#undef NoV28Links</A> in the
config.h file<p>
<B>Only</B> versions 2.9.1 and 2.9.2 can be linked on a net
where 2.7.x servers are present.
<p>
<B>Only</B> versions 2.9.1, 2.9.2 and 2.9.3 can be <em>directly</em>
linked to a 2.8.x server.
<p>
For many reasons (bandwidth usage, ND, CD) it is better to
run a homogenous network.  (Either all 2.8.x, or all 2.9.x).
<A NAME="misc-2">
<P><LI><B>What is ND, CD, TS?</B></P>
ND stands for Nick Delay which is a mechanism to prevent
nickname collisions,<br>
CD stands for Channel Delay which is a mechanism to prevent
channel collisions (op riding),<br>
TS stand for TimeStamp which is a mechanism to solve
nickname and channel collisions by deciding which of the two
concerned parties is right, and which is wrong.
<p>
Here are some links to documents that should help you:
<ul>
<LI> <A HREF="/web/20020408131601/http://www.irc.org/~irc/server/delays.html">Description
of 2.9 ND and CD</A>
<LI> <A HREF="/web/20020408131601/http://www.stealth.net/~kalt/irc/TS-Delay.html">Long comparaison of ND/CD and TS.</A>
<LI> <A HREF="/web/20020408131601/http://www.stealth.net/~kalt/irc/stats/collisions.html">Some comparative statistics between ND and TS.</A>
</ul>
<p>
2.9.x are the only versions implementing Nick and Channel Delay.
These two mechanisms have proven to be effective in greatly
reducing the number of channel takeovers, and nickname collisions.
<A NAME="misc-3">
<P><LI><B>What is ``flood control''?</B></P>
This is the name for the feature which prevents the server
to be flooded by clients.  It can be tuned via the
<A HREF="/web/20020408131601/http://www.stealth.net/~kalt/irc/config.html#FLOOD">CLIENT_FLOOD</A> define.  It is
different from the penalty system described below.  Both are
complementary.
<p>
If a client sends too much data to the server, its
connection will be closed.
<A NAME="misc-4">
<P><LI><B>What is ``penalty''?</B></P>
This feature appeared in 2.9.1 in replacement of some old
less flexible equivalent mechanism.  Each command of the
server has a penalty which will be applied to the client
running this command.
<p>
The penalty is defined in seconds.  If a user's penalty
exceeds 10 seconds, any incoming data is delayed, and only
processed when the penalty goes under 10 seconds again.
<p>
Many people would like a list of penalties, unfortunately,
it is quite difficult to make one.  The only way to know is
to RTFS.  

Most of the time, commands which affect the net
have a high penalty.  (For example, doing a remote WHOIS is
more penalized than doing a WHOIS locally).
<A NAME="misc-5">
<P><LI><B>What is a service?</B></P>
Bjørn Borud wrote ``<em>A service is something between a
client and a server connection.  if you read the docs
accompanying ircd 2.9.2 you will get some idea as to what it
can be used for given some knowledge of the IRC
protocol.</em>''
<p>
The code implementing services in the 2.9.2 server is not
complete, and a bug prevents services to be seen on the
whole irc network.  2.9.3 is the first version fully supporting
services (which abilities have been slightly enhanced).
<p>
Commands that a user can issue:
<ul>
<P><LI>SERVLIST &lt;pattern&gt; &lt;type&gt;</P>
This will return a list of matching services.
<P><LI>SQUERY &lt;pattern&gt; &lt;query&gt;</P>
This will send the string &lt;query&gt; to the first service
found which name matches &lt;pattern&gt;.
</ul>
<p>
Services can<B>not</B> join channels.
<p>
It is also interesting to note that services are not necessarily
seen by the whole IRC network.  A service which you cannot see
cannot see you either.  Services distribution is controlled by
a mask, for example *.fr would restrict a service to be present
only on french servers.
<p>
<A HREF="/web/20020408131601/http://www.stealth.net/~kalt/irc/service.html">Here</A> is a small perl script which
behaves as a service.
<A NAME="misc-6">
<P><LI><B>What does that character mean in the user log?</B></P>
This is defined in the common/struct_def.h file (previously
named include/struct.h) (see below) and tells why the client
connection was closed.
<pre>
#define EXITC_UNDEF     '-'     /* unregistered client */
#define EXITC_REG       '0'     /* normal exit */
#define EXITC_DIE       'd'     /* server died */

</pre>
<A NAME="misc-7">
<P><LI><B>What are those 4 last numbers in the logs?</B></P>
2.9.3 extends logging information by providing the amount of
data transferred during the connection between the client
and the server:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> number of messages sent to the client.
<LI> Kbytes sent to the client.
<LI> number of messages received by the server.
<LI> Kbytes received by the server.
</UL>
<A NAME="misc-8">

See <A HREF="/web/20020408131601/http://www.stealth.net/~kalt/irc/kills.html">http://www.stealth.net/~kalt/irc/kills.html</A>
for a complete description of KILL notices.
<P>
Note that the description field of server kills has changed
several times, this document describes the notices which can
be generated by the version 2.9.3 of the server.
<A NAME="misc-10">
<P><LI><B>Is ircd vulnerable to the DNS cache bug?</B></P>
Yes.
<P>
However, it is possible to protect the server from such abuse.
ircd reads the /etc/resolv.conf file to setup its own resolver
and will use the nameservers defined in this file.  There are
two ways ircd can be tricked to accept a wrong answer, both can be
defeated if the abusers cannot find the DNS server used by ircd.
<P>
The file used by ircd to setup its resolver can be changed at
compile time.  The default path (/etc/resolv.conf) is set in
include/resolv.h up to version 2.9.3
<P>
The 2.9.4 version introduces the option --resconf to configure
which makes it easy to use an alternate file.

<ol><ol>
<A NAME="compil-1">
<P><LI><B>How do I...?</B></P>
The compilation procedure is quite simple.  It is described
in the <B>doc/INSTALL.txt</B> file.  Good luck!
<A NAME="compil-2">
<P><LI><B>What is <A HREF="/web/20020408131601/http://www.stealth.net/~kalt/irc/config.html#DEBUG">#define DEBUGMODE</A>?</B></P>
It's a special mode that enable debugging code and notices.
It can be useful for people developping, but <B>it should
NEVER be used on a production network</B>.  It makes the
server to be much slower, and some special commands could be
used to crash it.
<A NAME="compil-3">
<P><LI><B>"parse error before `z_stream'" problems</A>?</B></P>
A common problem with the configuration leads to the following errors:
<pre>
In file included from ../ircd/s_defines.h:30,
                 from ../common/bsd.c:27:
../common/struct_def.h:317: parse error before `z_stream'

../common/struct_def.h:323: parse error before `}'
make: *** [bsd.o] Error 1
</pre>
<P>
These are caused by the fact that you have defined ZIP_LINKS, but configure
has not found the zlib which is required to support link compression.  Check
the <A HREF=/web/20020408131601/http://www.stealth.net/~kalt/irc/INSTALL-1.html#ss1.1>section
about configure in the INSTALL file</A> for clues on how to make configure
find the zlib (provided that it is installed on your system).
<A NAME="compil-4">
<p><LI><B>Undefined symbol errors compiling the client</B></P>
Some systems (in particular FreeBSD) have a weird ncurses library which
autoconf detects and decides to use to compile the client.  Unfortunately,
it doesn't work and results in errors when linking the client.  To get
around this problem, run configure with the --without-ncurses option,
and recompile the client.

<A NAME="config">
<H1>Configuration</H1>

<ol><ol>
<A NAME="config-1">
<P><LI><B>How do I...?</B></P>
Most questions about the configuration file should have an
answer in the <B>doc/INSTALL.txt</B> document file.
<B>example.conf</B> also has many interesting examples.
<P>
If you have a problem configuring the server, make sure to
check these two files.  They probably have the answer you're
looking for.
<P>
<B>chkconf</B> is a small utility which I encourage you to
use to find what is wrong in your ircd.conf.
<A NAME="config-2">
<P><LI><B>What are restricted connections?</B></P>
A restricted user:
<ul>
<li> cannot act as channel operator on normal #channels
(/mode, /kick, ..)
<li>cannot change nickname (/nick)
<li>can chat normally.
</ul>
The purpose of these connections is to allow access to the
server for people but limit their ability to abuse this
connection.  More information can be found at <A HREF="/web/20020408131601/http://www.irc.org/~irc/server/restricted.html">http://www.irc.org/~irc/server/restricted.html</A>
<A NAME="config-3">
<P><LI>What is ``ircd.tune'', when/how is it created?</B></P>
This file is used by the server to optimize memory usage, no
manual editing is required, nor should be needed.  As of
version 2.9 of the server, several data which were
statically allocated were changed to be allocated
dynamically, and allowed to grow in size when needed in
order to improve performance.  The server stores these
structures sizes in the ``ircd.tune'' file so the values are
known and used upon restart which improves the memory
allocation.
<P>
The file is overwritten everytime a value changes (grows),
upon rehashing the server, and when a ``/die'' or
``/restart'' command is issued.
<A NAME="config-4">
<P><LI>How do I use ``ircd.tune''?</B></P>
Typically you don't.  However, here are couple facts you
should know about the file:
<ul>
<LI> If you have never ran the server, and intend to run it
on a big IRC network, you should restart it within 48 hours,
and then about 1 week later (crashes not withstanding) to
build up a good idea of how it should start up.
<LI> If you have ran the server on a big IRC network, and
are no longer connecting to a big IRC network, the values
stored in the file are no longer adapted to your needs.
Remove the ``ircd.tune'' file, and restart the server.
</ul>

<ol><ol>
<A NAME="runtime-1">
<P><LI><B>My server is up and running, but it refuses connections</B></P>
<UL>
<P><LI><B>Connection refused</B></P>
The server is not listening, your configuration is probably
wrong, check your P lines.  If you are using the virtual
host support, check the configuration.
<P><LI><B>ERROR message</B></P>
The server is refusing the connection according to its
configuration file.  Check your ircd.conf
</UL>
<A NAME="runtime-2">
<P><LI><B>The server ``lags''</B></P>
This is often the first reaction of somebody upgrading from
an old version, such as 2.8.*; it seems that the server
lags 2 or 3 seconds with local clients.
<P>
This can be tuned with the <A HREF="/web/20020408131601/http://www.stealth.net/~kalt/irc/config.html#HUB">HUB</A>
define in the config.h file.  2.9.x servers are optimized
for networking, to the disadvantage of local clients.
<P>
Note that if you don't link many servers, HUB can be defined
to 0.  And if you don't link any server at all, you should
probably simply #undef'ine HUB.
<A NAME="runtime-3">
<P><LI><B>What happenned to global messages?</B></P>
The code for these has been pretty broken in 2.9.1 and
2.9.2, but it is fixed in 2.9.3.
<A NAME="runtime-4">
<P><LI><B>What happenned to the +s usermode?</B></P>
2.9.x versions of the server no longer support this user
mode.  To receive the server notices, you have to join some
local channels:
<ul>
<li> &ERRORS: Error messages concerning server and network.
<li> &NOTICES: Informative and administrative notices from server.
<li> &KILLS: Kill messages for users, collisions.
<li> &CHANNEL: Channel mode desynchronation warnings. 
<li> &NUMERICS: IRC server protocol errors between servers, misrouted replies. 
<li> &SERVERS: Introduction of new servers and splits of existing ones. 
<li> &HASH: Server internal hash lookup table statistics. 
<li> &LOCAL: Server local configuration warnings. 
<li> &SERVICES: Introduction of new services, and quits of existing ones.
</ul>
<A NAME="runtime-5">
<P><LI><B>My server complains about ``Too many open files''</B></P>
This means that your server has opened as many file
descriptors as it was allowed to.  It is an OS dependant
issue, but most unix shells have a ``limit'' command which
can be used to put a limit lower than the actual kernel
limit per process.
<p>
To solve your problem, make sure that your shell doesn't
limit the number of descriptors.  Then, if you still see
this notice, it means you are hitting the kernel limit, in
which case you should reconfigure your kernel.
<p>
The <A HREF="/web/20020408131601/http://www.stealth.net/~kalt/irc/config.html#MAXCONN">MAXCONNECTIONS</A> define
in the config.h should always be lower than the maximum
number of file descriptors a process can open.  If this is
the case, the ``Too many open files'' notice will never show
up.
<A NAME="runtime-6">
<P><LI><B>The ``is now operator'' notice is wrong</B></P>
This notice was changed to show (lowercase) ``o'' for global
IRC operators, and (uppercase) ``O'' for local ones.  The
change was made to be coherent with the IRC protocol
(<A HREF="/web/20020408131601/http://www.stealth.net/~kalt/irc/rfc1459.html">RFC 1459</A>) between servers.
<p>
It seems wrong because it is the opposite of the
``ircd.conf'' file.
<A NAME="runtime-7">
<P><LI><B>The ``KLINE'' command doesn't work</B></P>
This command was never part of the official distribution.
There are several reasons which make it unlikely to ever
be part of it.  The ``KLINE'' command can be seen as a subset
of commands allowing a client connected to IRC to modify
the configuration of a server while online.  Implementing
such a command would mean introducing in the server the means
of modifying the configuration in an uncomplete maneer.  It also
means allowing a client to interactively modify a file on disk,
relying on poor authentication (typically, on IRC operator
status).
<P>
The IRC server configuration file is complex.  Currently there
is no tool that can be used for remotely administrating it.
Such a tool should not be implemented in the IRC server itself,
but as a separate program using strong and secure authentication.
<A NAME="runtime-8">
<P><LI><B>What are these errors: "udp port recvfrom (my.server.name): Connection refused"?</B></P>
When you have uplinks to which you autoconnect, the server
uses UDP to ping them.  The pings are sent to the same port
number as the one you use to autoconnect (unless specified
otherwise, see <B>doc/INSTALL.txt</B>).  If your uplink doesn't
listen for UDP packets on this particular port, or if there
is a firewall not letting the UDP packets go through, your
server complains with the error message above.
<P>
You can most likely correct this by fixing either your, or
your uplink's configuration.  Check <B>doc/INSTALL.txt</B> on M
and C lines about UDP pings.
<A NAME="runtime-9">
<P><LI><B>The server hangs when auto connecting to an unreachable host</B></P>
When connecting to an unreachable host (manual or auto connect),
the connection attempt will timeout after 30 seconds or so, at
which point the ircd process hangs on some Solaris systems.
The affected versions are 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.5.1; <B>Solaris 2.6
doesn't have this problem</B>.
