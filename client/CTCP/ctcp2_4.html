<H2>4. CTCP Requests and Replies</H2>
   
<P>
A list of standard defined CTCP requests and replies follows.  Some CTCP
keywords are only valid as a request, while one (ERRMSG) is only valid as
a reply.  This is noted where applicable.  The requests are listed as
either "required" or "optional".  It should be noted that implementation
of CTCP requests as a whole is optional.  However, if you choose to
implement CTCP, you must implement all "required" requests in order to
be compliant with the CTCP specification.

<H3>4.1 VERSION (required)</H3>

<P>
Request: 'VERSION'<BR>
Reply: 'VERSION' SP user-text

<P>
This request will provide to the initiator information about the 
particular client is being used by the recipient.  A valid request will
have no arguments accompanying it.

<P>
The user-text is extracted by concatenating all remaining parameters
together, separated by spaces.  Thus a VERSION with the user-text of
"ircIII it's great!" can be sent as a CTCP VERSION with three parameters:
"ircIII", "it's", and "great!".  This behavior is intended to provide
compatibility with older IRC clients.  While it is possible (and valid)
to send a CTCP VERSION request with only one parameter, having all spaces
quoted (according to section 3), clients are encouraged instead to send
the user-text as multiple parameters with no quoted spaces, so that older
clients can decode them.

<P>
It is not required that any useful information be encoded into a VERSION
reply, or that a VERSION reply be machine-readable.  The VERSION reply
is intended to be seen by humans.  Suggested information includes the
IRC client's name and version, the operating system, and a contact address
for the individual or organization responsible for the client.

<P>
Older IRC clients revealed information about obtaining a copy of the
client via CTCP SOURCE.  We have chosen to deprecate SOURCE in favor of
returning this information inside a VERSION reply.  Use of the "URL"
attribute (see section 2.8) in a VERSION reply for revealing a site with
more information about the IRC client is encouraged.

<P>

<H3>4.2  PING (required)</H3>

<P>
Request: "PING" SP arg<BR>
Reply: "PING" SP arg

<P>
This request is intended to determine the round trip time of a message 
from the initiator to the recipient and back to the initiator.  The
recipient is required to return a duplicate of the received argument
without modification.  Each client will define its own format for the
argument.

<P>
An argument longer than 32 octets may be truncated by the recipient (to
a minimum of 32 octects in length) before it is echoed back.

<H3>4.3 CLIENTINFO (required)</H3>

<P>
Request: "CLIENTINFO"<BR>
Reply: "CLIENTINFO" *( SP keyword )

<P>
This request will be used to inquire of the capabilities of a client. 
The response will be a space-separated list of the valid request keywords
recognised by this client.

<P>
The previous implementation of this command allowed for an argument which
would provide additional information about the command, acting like a 
help reference.  In the interests of cutting down on the flood potential 
of clients, as well as the recent need to maintain local help files, 
this optional behavior is deprecated.

<P>

<H3>4.4 ACTION (required)</H3>

<P>
Request: "ACTION" SP user-text<BR>
There is no reply.

<P>
This request is used to provide an alternative form of speaking either 
to an individual or channel.  This text should be treated in a manner
similar to a PRIVMSG from RFC 1459.  Alternate display methods are
encouraged.

<P>
Note that the comment on user-text from VERSION (section 4.1 above) applies
here also.

<P>
No reply is made to this request.

<P>

<H3>4.5 FINGER (optional)</H3>

<P>
Request: "FINGER"<BR>
Reply: "FINGER" SP user-text

<P>
The response to this request will be a user specified text string, and 
may contain any valid ASCII character 32 or above.  No restrictions are
placed on the content of this reply.

<P>
The FINGER request is intended to include the deprecated USERINFO request
in its domain.  A FINGER reply is generally expected to have some information
about the user, although none is required.  There is no specified format
for a FINGER response, so any client that attempts to automatically extract
information such as idle time should prepare to be ocassionally disappointed.
Inclusion of a homepage or web site using the "URL" attribute (see section
2.8) is encouraged.

<P>
Note that the comment on user-text from VERSION (section 4.1 above) applies
here also.

<P>

<H3>4.6 TIME (optional)</H3>

<P>
Request: "TIME"<BR>
Reply: "TIME" SP date-time

<P>
The response to this request will be the date and time of the system the
client is running on.  The format of this reply must be that used be
RFC822, section 5, with the following modification: the year must be
a four-digit (not two-digit) number.  The time should be given in the
local timezone, with the timezone given as an offset.

<P>
This modified format is listed in Appendix B for reference.  An example
of a valid TIME reply is: "Wed, 11 Jun 1997 18:55 -0700".

<P>
The old format, which looked like "Wed Aug 20 23:29:21 1997", is now
deprecated, but clients may want to recognize it for compatibility
reasons.

<P>
Note that, as in VERSION (section 4.1 above), quoting the spaces is not
recommended.

<P>

<H3>4.7 DCC (optional)</H3>

<P>
Request: "DCC" SP dcc-type SP dcc-protocol SP ip SP port *( SP dcc-arg )
A reply may be sent if the request was a "firewall request" (see section
5).

<P>
This implements the Direct Client to Client protocol.  The intent of 
this protocol is to facilitate the transfer of information from client 
to client, without directly accessing the IRC network.  An initial 
message is sent from the initiator to the recipient, where an IP and 
port are extracted from the message and a direct TCP connection is
established.  The intent of the connection is indicated by the dcc-type
field in the original message.

<P>
DCC requests are explained in section 5.

<P>

<H3>4.8 ERRMSG (optional)</H3>

<P>
This must not be sent as a request.<BR>
Reply: "ERRMSG" SP keyword *( SP user-text )

<P>
ERRMSG is used as a reply indicating that there was something wrong with
a previous CTCP request.  Usually it should contain information about why
the request failed, in a human-readable format.  Some CTCP requests
(notably DCC) define some standard ERRMSG replies that may be used to
indicate certain problems.

<P>
Note that the comment on user-text from VERSION (section 4.1 above) applies
here also.

<P>
It is optional for an IRC client to send ERRMSG replies, though they are
generally helpful to a user who receives them.

<P>
[still slightly controversial...]

<P>

<H3>4.9 PLAY (optional)</H3>

<P>
Request: "PLAY" SP filename SP mime-type<BR>
Reply: "PLAY" SP filename SP mime-type

<P>
A PLAY request is a request to display or launch some file previously sent
via a DCC XFER or DCC OFFER.  The filename and mime-type must exactly match
an existing downloaded file, and the file must have originally been sent
with the "DO PLAYABLE" option (see section 5.1.2).  As with DCC XFER, the
filename may need to be adjusted by the receiving client to avoid characters
which are "special" to that client's operating system (such as directory
dividers).

<P>
Clients should be careful when answering a PLAY request, and allow the user
full control over whether a PLAY request is honored.  There is potential for
abuse, so it is recommended that a client only honor PLAY requests for
images, sounds, or videos.  Under no circumstances should a client PLAY any
type of executable file.

<P>
If the receiving client does not have the file referenced by the PLAY
request, it may send a PLAY reply back to the originator.  This reply may
be used by the originator to initiate a DCC XFER of the file.  In this way,
two clients may negotiate the launching of a file that has not been
previously transferred.  This automatic transfer must never happen unless
the user has indicated his/her consent to the client.  Unattended automatic
file transfers are a possible security violation and should be handled with
care.

<P>

<H3>4.10 Client Extensions</H3>

<P>
There is often reason for clients to implement extension CTCP commands
which are not part of the document. To mark these as extensions, the
author should prefix a command with "X-".  If the author is concerned
about name collisions between differing implementations, he should
prefix it further with some unique identifier, such as the client name,
the script name, the author's nick, etc.

<P>
This document can't (and doesn't try to) forsee all the uses to which CTCP
messages will be put.  Therefore, a subset of CTCP keywords are reserved
for experimental or client-specific CTCP messages.  Following the lead of
the MIME standard, CTCP keywords that start with "X-" are reserved for
these messages.  For example, a client that wishes to implement an online
paging system could use "X-PAGE".

<P>
If a client author is concerned about name collisions between differing
implementations, he should prefix it further with some unique identifier,
such as the client name, the script name, the author's nick, etc.  For
example, "X-IRCII-PAGE".

<P>
A client can silently ignore any of these "extended" keywords which it
does not understand.  All extensions to CTCP that are not listed in this
document should be preceded with "X-" until they are added to the standard.

<P>

<H3>4.11 Deprecations</H3>

<P>
Currently there are clients which implement requests which are of no
significant value in the face of these specificiations.  A client may
respond to these deprecated requests, it may ignore them, or it may
respond with an ERRMSG reply.  The list of deprecated requests is:
ECHO, SED, USERINFO, UTC, ERRMSG (as a request), CLIENTINFO &lt;arg&gt;, SOURCE,
and DCC SEND.
