<H2><A NAME="INTRO">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P>
This document describes CTCP version 2 (CTCP2).

<P>
In order to facilitate the exchange of information with in the IRC
networks, users have indicated desire to transmit files, determine
transmission times and send specialized text messages.  As RFC 1459 
offers no direct means to exchange such requests, a protocol built upon
RFC 1459's is required.  This protocol is known as CTCP (or Client
To Client Protocol).

<P>
The original CTCP definition specified only request and reply messages,
but allowed users to transfer files over IRC, measure lag (network delay),
and retreive automated responses to queries about a user's IRC client or
time zone.

<P>
Over the course of time, CTCP has been expanded by various sources, and
what was once a "standard" has become increasingly less so.  This document
is an attempt to clarify earlier CTCP documentation and standardize some of
the new features that have become commonplace since then.  In addition,
some new functionality has been added in anticipation of future clients,
and the extensibility of CTCP has been greatly improved.

<P>
In a few cases, extensibility has been chosen over compatibility.  For
that reason, CTCP2 is not completely compatible with the original CTCP.
Clients that understand CTCP will not necessarily understand CTCP2.
Clients that understand CTCP2 can be made compatible with the original
CTCP, but this is not required.

<P>

<H3>1.1 Conventions</H3>

<P>
This document uses a mechanism known as "augmented Backus-Naur Form"
(BNF) for most of its specifications.  A description of this augmented
BNF can be found in RFC 2068 (HTTP/1.1) and RFC 822 (email) among many
other places.  Please consult one of those RFCs for a full description.
A few of the major elements this document uses are:

<PRE>
"literal"
   Anything in double quotes is a literal text string.  Unless stated
   otherwise, it is case-insensitive.
*rule
   This indicates repitition, allowing 0 or more occurances of this
   element.  A common derivitive is "1*rule" which specifies 1 or
   more occurances.
[rule]
   Square brackets indicate an optional element or elements.
</PRE>

<P>
Unless stated otherwise, there are is no implied whitespace.  Areas
where whitespace is allowed will be clearly marked.

<P>

<H3>1.2 Base Definitions</H3>

<P>
These are standard definitions that will show up throughout the document.

<PRE>
OCTET	= &lt;any 8-bit sequence of data&gt;
ALPHA	= &lt;any US-ASCII uppercase or lowercase letter&gt;
DIGIT	= &lt;any US-ASCII digit "0".."9"&gt;
NUL	= &lt;US-ASCII character 0 (octal 000)&gt;
LF	= &lt;US-ASCII character 10 (octal 012)&gt;
CR	= &lt;US-ASCII character 13 (octal 015)&gt;
SP	= &lt;US-ASCII character 32 (octal 040)&gt;
</PRE>
