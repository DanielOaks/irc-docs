<BODY>
<P>This document is an overview of all the parameters used in the 005 numeric
(RPL_ISUPPORT)
of the IRC protocol, with a short description of what all the parameters mean.
<P>
For a more formal defenition of the ISUPPORT numeric see <A
HREF="http://www.irc.org/tech_docs/draft-brocklesby-irc-isupport-03.txt">Edward Brocklesby's ISUPPORT
draft.</A>
<P>
This page now just lists some examples of what is being used, which include
things not in the draft.
The reason they're not in draft is because they are either experimental or
considered to be of no real use.
<P>A simple example output:
<P><SAMP>
:irc.example.org 005 nick PREFIX=(ov)@+ CHANTYPES=#&amp; :are supported by this server
</SAMP>
<P>Here is the list with all parameters with a short description:

<P>Some of those parameters define a length.  This is a length in octets and
not in (multi-byte) characters.
<P>I would like to be able to place some links to commands like SILENCE,
USERIP, CPRIVMSG, CNOTICE, KNOCK, and others.  Whatever may be useful to
client authors.  They don't seem to put any documentation online.
<P>Some older version of this document said CHARMAPPING instead of
CASEMAPPING.  This was an error and has been corrected.
<P>CHARSET has been removed.  See the draft for explanation.
