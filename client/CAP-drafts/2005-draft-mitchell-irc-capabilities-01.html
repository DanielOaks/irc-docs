<span class="grey">Internet-Draft                  IRC CAP                       March 2005</span>

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The IRC protocol, as originally documented by <a href="./rfc1459">RFC 1459</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title="&quot;Internet Relay Chat Protocol&quot;">2</a>] and
   updated by <a href="./rfc2812">RFC 2812</a> [<a href="#ref-3" title="&quot;Internet Relay Chat: Client Protocol&quot;">3</a>], is a simple, text-based conferencing
   protocol, involving a number of users spread across a number of
   interconnected servers.  These users may chat with other individual
   users, or may chat with groups of users on "channels"--what other
   chat systems refer to as "rooms" or "chat rooms".

   Over the years, various extensions to the basic IRC protocol have
   been made by IRC server programmers.  Often, these extensions are
   intended to conserve bandwidth, close loopholes left by the original
   protocol specification, or add features for users or for the server
   administrators.  Most of these changes are backwards-compatible with
   the original protocol specification: A command may be added, a reply
   may be extended to contain more parameters, etc.  Recently, however,
   there has been a desire to introduce changes that would not be
   backwards-compatible with existing IRC clients.  Ideally, these
   protocol changes would only be used with clients and servers that can
   understand the revised protocol.  Unfortunately, the IRC protocol
   does not provide any form of extension or protocol negotiation,
   making it impossible to determine support for such extensions.

   This memo introduces a standardized mechanism for negotiation of
   protocol extensions, known as *capabilities*, that will be
   backwards-compatible with all existing IRC clients and servers.  Any
   server not implementing this extension will still interoperate with
   clients that do implement it; similarly, clients that do not
   implement the capabilities extension may successfully communicate
   with a server that does implement the extension.

<span class="grey">Internet-Draft                  IRC CAP                       March 2005</span>

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Problems to be Solved</span>

   The IRC protocol is not a lockstep protocol.  This means that a
   client may issue additional commands before the server has finished
   responding to the first one.  Additionally, unlike other protocols,
   the server does not necessarily issue a banner response upon initial
   connection.  This, combined with the fact that some servers do not
   complain about unknown commands prior to completion of the client
   registration phase, means that a client cannot know for certain
   whether a server implements the extension.  If a client had to wait
   for a banner message, it would fail to interoperate with a server not
   implementing the capabilities extension.  If the client must issue a
   command and then wait for a response, a similar problem results.  As
   some potential protocol extensions must be set up prior to completion
   of the client registration phase, there is no reliable way a server
   may indicate implementation of the capabilities extension to a
   client.

   The solution to these problems turns out to be to extend the client
   registration procedure.  The client sends a request to begin
   capability negotiation, as well as the other information necessary
   for client registration (user name, nick name, optional password,
   etc.).  If the server understands the capabilities extension, it will
   suspend completion of the registration phase until the negotiation is
   complete; negotiation may then proceed in a lockstep fashion.  If the
   server does not understand capabilities, then the registration will
   complete immediately, and the client will receive the 001 numeric.
   This will signal to the client that the server does not implement the
   capabilities extension.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  The CAP Command</span>

   The capabilities extension is implemented by addition of one command
   with several subcommands.  The command added is *CAP*.  CAP takes a
   single, required subcommand, optionally followed by a single
   parameter consisting of a space-separated list of capabilities.  Each
   capability within the list MAY be preceded by a capability modifier.
   (<a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>)

   The subcommands defined for CAP are:

   1.  LS (<a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>)

   [<a href="#ref-2" title="&quot;Internet Relay Chat Protocol&quot;">2</a>].

   The discussion in the following sections applies only to clients and
   servers implementing the capabilities extension.  Servers (and
   clients) not implementing the capabilities extension are exempted
   from the requirements of this section.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.1" href="#section-3.1">3.1</a>  CAP LS</span>

   The LS subcommand is used to list the capabilities supported by the
   server.  The client SHALL send an LS subcommand with no arguments to
   solicit a list of supported capabilities from the server.  Servers
   MUST respond to such LS subcommands with one or more LS subcommands
   containing the list of recognized capabilities.  All but the last
   subcommand MUST have a parameter containing only an asterisk ('*')
   preceding the capability list.

   If a client issues an LS subcommand during the client registration
   phase, client registration MUST be suspended until an END (<a href="#section-3.7">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-3.7">3.7</a>) subcommand is received.

   ABNF [<a href="#ref-4" title="&quot;Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF&quot;">4</a>] description of the LS subcommand:

          lscmd        =  "LS"
          lscmd        =/ "LS" SP [ "*" SP ] caplist

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.2" href="#section-3.2">3.2</a>  CAP LIST</span>

   The LIST subcommand is provided to permit the client to request a
   list of the capabilities currently active for the connection.  It is
   similar to the LS (<a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>) subcommand--if a client issues a LIST
   subcommand with no arguments, the server MUST respond with a sequence
   of LIST subcommands, all but the last of which MUST have a single
   parameter consisting solely of an asterisk ('*') preceding the list
   of capabilities.  If no capabilities have been enabled, the server
   MUST send a LIST command with an empty capability list; the parameter
   MUST NOT be omitted.  The active capabilities MAY be listed in any
   order.

   ABNF [<a href="#ref-4" title="&quot;Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF&quot;">4</a>] description of the LIST subcommand:

          listcmd      =  "LIST"

<span class="grey">Internet-Draft                  IRC CAP                       March 2005</span>

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.3" href="#section-3.3">3.3</a>  CAP REQ</span>

   The REQ subcommand is sent by the client to request that a capability
   or set of capabilities be enabled or disabled.  Its sole parameter
   MUST be a space-separated list of capabilities.  Each capability name
   MAY be preceded by a dash ('-') to indicate that the capability
   should be disabled.  Additionally, receipt of this subcommand during
   the client registration MUST suspend client registration until an END
   (<a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a>) subcommand is received.

   Servers MUST respond to a REQ command with either the ACK (<a href="#section-3.4">Section</a>
   <a href="#section-3.4">3.4</a>) or NAK (<a href="#section-3.5">Section 3.5</a>) subcommands to indicate acceptance or
   rejection of the capability set requested by the client.  A server
   MUST accept the entire capability set or reject it whole; servers
   MUST NOT accept some capabilities in the set while rejecting others.
   If a client requests that a "sticky" capability be disabled, the
   server MUST reject the capability set.

   ABNF [<a href="#ref-4" title="&quot;Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF&quot;">4</a>] description of the REQ subcommand:

          reqcmd       =  "REQ" SP caplist

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.4" href="#section-3.4">3.4</a>  CAP ACK</span>

   The ACK subcommand has three uses.  It is used by the server to
   acknowledge a REQ (<a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>) subcommand; by the server to
   acknowledge a CLEAR (<a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>) subcommand and list the removed
   capabilities; and by the client to acknowledge certain capabilities
   designated as requiring acknowledgment.  If more than one ACK is
   required due to the IRC line length limitation of 512 characters, all
   but the last SHALL contain a parameter consisting of a single
   asterisk ('*') immediately preceding the list of capabilities, as for
   LS (<a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>) and LIST (<a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>).

   If an ACK reply originating from the server is spread across multiple
   lines, a client MUST NOT change capabilities until the last ACK of
   the set is received.  Equally, a server MUST NOT change the
   capabilities of the client until the last ACK of the set has been
   sent.

   In the first usage, acknowledging a REQ (<a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>) subcommand, the
   ACK subcommand has a single parameter consisting of a space separated
   list of capability names, which may optionally be preceded with one
   or more modifiers (<a href="#section-5.1">Section 5.1</a>).

   The second usage, acknowledging a CLEAR (<a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>) subcommand, is
   similar to the first usage.  When a CLEAR (<a href="#section-3.6">Section 3.6</a>) subcommand is

   issued, all non-"sticky" capabilities are disabled, and a set of ACK
   subcommands will be generated by the server with the disable modifier
   preceding each capability.

   The third usage is when, in the preceding two cases, some capability
   names have been preceded with the ack modifier.  ACK in this case is
   used to fully enable or disable the capability.  Clients MUST NOT
   issue an ACK subcommand for any capability not marked with the ack
   modifier in a server-generated ACK subcommand.

   ABNF [<a href="#ref-4" title="&quot;Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF&quot;">4</a>] description of the ACK subcommand:

          ackcmd       =  "ACK" SP [ "*" SP ] caplist

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.5" href="#section-3.5">3.5</a>  CAP NAK</span>

   The NAK subcommand MUST be sent by the server in response to a REQ
   (<a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>) subcommand when any capability change requested cannot
   be performed for any reason.  The server MUST NOT make any change to
   the set of capabilities for the client if it responds with a NAK
   subcommand.  The argument of the NAK subcommand MUST consist of at
   least the first one hundred characters of the capability list in the
   REQ (<a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>) subcommand which triggered the NAK.

   ABNF [<a href="#ref-4" title="&quot;Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF&quot;">4</a>] description of the NAK subcommand:

          nakcmd       =  "NAK" SP ":" acklist
                           ; acklist is at least 100 characters of the
                           ; capability list from the REQ

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.6" href="#section-3.6">3.6</a>  CAP CLEAR</span>

   The CLEAR subcommand requests that the server clear the capability
   set for the client.  The server MUST respond with a set of ACK
   (<a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>) subcommands indicating the capabilities being
   deactivated.

   ABNF [<a href="#ref-4" title="&quot;Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF&quot;">4</a>] description of the CLEAR subcommand:

          clearcmd     =  "CLEAR"

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" name="section-3.7" href="#section-3.7">3.7</a>  CAP END</span>

   The END subcommand signals to the server that capability negotiation
   is complete and requests that the server continue with client

   registration.  If the client is already registered, this command MUST
   be ignored by the server.

   Clients that support capabilities but do not wish to enter
   negotiation SHOULD send CAP END upon connection to the server.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Capability Negotiation</span>

   Clients implementing this extension SHOULD take one of the following
   three actions upon initial connection to a server:

   o  Issue an LS (<a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>) subcommand (with an empty capability
      list) to solicit a list of supported capabilities from the server;

   o  Issue the REQ (<a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>) subcommand to request a particular set
      of capabilities without knowing what capabilities the server
      supports or if it supports the capabilities extension; or

   o  Issue the END (<a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a>) subcommand to signal implementation of
      the capabilities extension without entering into capability
      negotiation.

   Although a client is permitted to not issue any CAP commands upon
   connection, this is NOT RECOMMENDED.  Servers MAY assume a client
   does not implement the capabilities extension if it does not issue
   any CAP commands upon initial connection.

   Clients SHOULD follow CAP commands issued upon connection with the
   standard IRC client registration commands without waiting for any
   responses from the server.  See <a href="./rfc1459">RFC 1459</a> [<a href="#ref-2" title="&quot;Internet Relay Chat Protocol&quot;">2</a>] for more details about
   the client registration procedure.

   If a client issues the LS (<a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>) or REQ (<a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>)
   subcommands during the client registration procedure, a server
   implementing the capabilities extension MUST NOT complete the client
   registration until the client issues the END (<a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a>)
   subcommand.  A client that sees a RPL_WELCOME (001) numeric response
   before it sends CAP END (<a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a>) SHOULD assume that the server
   does not support the capabilities extension.

   Once the client is registered, CAP commands SHALL have no effect on
   other connection operations, except that a client MAY change the
   capabilities it has set.  In particular, CAP commands and their
   responses MAY be interspersed with other protocol messages.  The END
   (<a href="#section-3.7">Section 3.7</a>) subcommand SHALL have no effect once client
   registration has been completed.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Capabilities</span>

   Capabilities are designated by a name composed of one or more
   elements.  Name elements are not case-sensitive.  They must begin
   with a letter and may contain any number of letters, numbers, and the
   dash character ('-').  Names containing more than one name element
   MUST also contain a period character ('.') in the first name element.
   Name elements are separated from each other via the slash character
   ('/').

   There are two capability name spaces:

   Network Specific: Names whose first element contains a period
      character ('.') designate a delegated capability name space.  The
      first element MUST be a valid, existing DNS domain name.  These
      names MUST contain at least two elements.

   Standardized: All other names MUST correspond to capabilities
      documented by an RFC.  Further, these names MUST contain only one
      element.

   These rules are summarized by the following ABNF [<a href="#ref-4" title="&quot;Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF&quot;">4</a>] representation:

          elem         =  ALPHA *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" )

          netname      =  elem 1*( "." elem )

          netDeleg     =  netname 1*( "/" elem )

          standardized =  elem

   There are various capability modifiers available.  If a capability
   modifier is to be used, it MUST directly precede the capability name.
   The following are the modifiers defined for capabilities.  Certain
   modifiers MAY be combined.

   The disable modifier is used by both the server and the client to
   indicate that a capability should be disabled.  The disable modifier
   is defined as the dash character ('-').  A client MUST only use the
   disable modifier in the REQ (<a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>) and ACK (<a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>)
   subcommands.  A server MUST use the disable modifier in the ACK

   (<a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>) subcommand when disabling a capability, or in
   conjunction with a ack modifier in the LIST (<a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>) subcommand.
   The server MUST NOT use the disable modifier in any other command
   response.

   The sticky modifier is used by the server to indicate a capability
   that, once enabled, cannot be disabled.  The sticky modifier is
   defined as the equals character ('=').  A client MUST NOT use the
   sticky modifier.  A server MUST only use the sticky modifier in the
   ACK (<a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>), LIST (<a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>) and LS (<a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>)
   subcommands and MUST use the modifier for all such capabilities.

   The ack modifier is used by the server to indicate that the client
   must issue an ACK (<a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>) subcommand to fully enable or disable
   the capability.  The ack modifier is defined as the tilde character
   ('~').  The ack modifier indicates that traffic originating from the
   server SHALL make use of the capability, but the server SHALL NOT
   expect traffic originating from the client to make use of the
   capability.  When combined with the disable modifier, it indicates
   traffic originating from the server SHALL NOT make use of the
   capability, but the server expects traffic originating from the
   client SHALL make use of the capability.  The ack modifier MAY be
   combined with the sticky modifier.

   A server MUST use the ack modifier in the ACK (<a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>) and LIST
   (<a href="#section-3.2">Section 3.2</a>) subcommands to indicate capabilities that require an
   ACK (<a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>) subcommand from the client to be fully enabled or
   disabled.  Servers MUST also use the ack modifier in the response to
   an LS (<a href="#section-3.1">Section 3.1</a>) subcommand to indicate capabilities which will
   require ACK (<a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>) subcommands from the client.  Clients MUST
   NOT use the ack modifier, but SHOULD issue the ACK (<a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>)
   subcommand as soon as possible after receiving an ACK (<a href="#section-3.4">Section 3.4</a>)
   or REQ (<a href="#section-3.3">Section 3.3</a>) subcommand from the server that contains a
   capability marked with the ack modifier.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" name="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   Capabilities are an extension to a preexisting, insecure chat
   protocol.  This extension does not add and does not purport to add
   any security to the IRC protocol.  Capability negotiation occurs
   after client registration has already begun.  Moreover, no mechanism
   is defined that allows parameters to be passed for specific
   capabilities.  Although such a mechanism could be added,
   cryptographic security systems frequently require several exchanges
   to establish a secure context, particularly if authentication must
   also be negotiated.  Thus, the capabilities extension is unsuited to
   the implementation of those protocols, and other mechanisms, such as
   SSL-encapsulated IRC, should be used.

   In the following examples, lines preceded by "CLIENT:" indicate
   protocol messages sent by the client, and lines preceded by "SERVER:"
   indicate protocol messages sent by the server.  For clarity, the
   origin field for server-originated protocol messages has been
   omitted.  This field would consist of a colon (':') followed by the
   full server name, and would be the first field in the command.

         first form of ACK.

      *  Remove an unnecessary "MAY" in documentation for the third
         usage of ACK.

      *  Explicitly note in the ABNF for NAK that the parameter is an
         opaque repeat of at least the first 100 characters of the
         argument to REQ.

      *  CLEAR may result in more than one ACK.

      *  Clarify the language of what composes a capability name.

      *  Allow disable modifier in LIST, but only in conjunction with an
         ack modifier.

      *  The ack modifier may also show up in an LS response; rewrote
         the final paragraph to indicate that and clarify the language.

      *  Add "Client" to the title in the appropriate place...

      *  The "capability" rule in the ABNF got changed to "capab" for
         brevity.

      *  Update "date" to be current.

   2005-01-22 LH

      *  Clarify a client must not act upon an ACK spread across
         multiple lines until it receives the final ACK of the set.

   2005-01-23 KLM

      *  Bump version number in preparation for any suggested edits...
